            "abstract": "© 2016 Elsevier Ltd Bulk heterojunction films made of polychiral single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) form efficient heterojunction solar cells with n-type crystalline silicon (n-Si), due to their superior electronic, optical, and electrical properties. The films are multi-functional, since their hierarchical surface morphology provides a biomimetical anti-reflective, air-stable, and hydrophobic encapsulation for Si. Also, the films have a large effective area conferring them high optical absorption, which actively contribute to the solar energy harvesting together with Si. Here, we report photovoltaic devices with photoconversion efficiency up to 12% and a record 100% internal quantum efficiency (IQE). Such unprecedented IQE value is truly remarkable and indicates that every absorbed photon from the device, at some wavelengths, generates a pair of separated charge carriers, which are collected at the electrodes. The SWCNT/Si devices favor high and broadband carrier photogeneration; charge dissociation of ultra-fast hot excitons; transport of electrons through n-Si and high-mobility holes through the SWCNT percolative network. Moreover, by varying the film thickness, it is possible to tailor the physical properties of such a two-dimensional interacting system, therefore the overall device features. These results not only pave the way for low-cost, high-efficient, and broadband photovoltaics, but also are promising for the development of generic SWCNT-based optoelectronic applications.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 IEEE.Robots are at the evolution stage that will bring them to interact with humans in daily activities. This will lead to a direct contact with all the members of a household. It is important therefore to understand whether a robot behavior designed for adults could fit also the needs of their younger relatives. In particular, in this work we investigate whether the acceptance and basic understanding of robot behaviors changes between the onset of adolescence and adulthood. With a series of video-based tests we address three different aspects of the interaction: A) the a priori expectations of the prospective users on the most appropriate features of an interactive robot; b) their subjective preferences about a humanoid robot verbal and non-verbal behavior in a demonstration task; and c) the quantitative effect of robot gaze and hand motion on the ability of its human partner to understand its goal. The results show a remarkable similarity between teenagers and adults in all the subjective and quantitative metrics considered, suggesting that a robot behavior designed for adults would be probably effective also in the interaction with 13-year-olds. Our findings also underline the high relevance of an appropriate design of robot gaze direction, as both age groups relied substantially on this implicit cue in their understanding of robot goals.",

            "abstract": "© Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2017.A great technological and scientific challenge is related to the fabrication of confined structures where the light is confined in systems with characteristic dimensions scale from micro to nanometers. The nanotechnology, that allows the study of innovative functional materials and gives advances in the miniaturization, has opened the way to the manufacturing of such structures and focalize the attention of new features of light-matter interaction (Ristic D et. al, Proc ICTON Tu. B 5.2:1–5, 2013). An example concerns planar microcavities, or one-dimensional (1-D) photonic crystals, which are the simplest photonic band – gap (PBG) devices exploitable to manage the spectroscopic properties of luminescent species such as rare earth ions (Valligatla S, Chiasera A, Varas S, Bazzanella N, Narayana Rao D, Righini GC, Ferrari M, Opt Express 20:21214, 2012) and quantum dots (Jasieniak J, Sada C, Chiasera A, Ferrari M, Martucci A, Mulvaney P, Adv Funct Mater 18:3772, 2008). The fundamental optical principle for the photonic crystals is, “localization of light” (John S, Phys Rev Lett 58:2486, 1987) so that combination of photonic crystals and nonlinear optics leads us towards new nonlinear optical devices (Ma GH, Shen J, Rajiv K, Tamg SH, Zhang ZJ, Hua ZY, Appl Phys B 80:359, 2005; Valligatla S, Chiasera A, Krishna MBM, Varas S, Narayana Rao D, Ferrari M, Righini GC, Int Conf Fiber Opt Photon 2012:W1C.2).",

            "abstract": "© 2016 Acta Materialia Inc. We fabricated three-dimensional microtissues with the aim to replicate in vitro the composition and the functionalities of the tumor microenvironment. By arranging either normal fibroblasts (NF) or cancer-activated fibroblasts (CAF) in two different three dimensional (3D) configurations, two kinds of micromodules were produced: spheroids and microtissues. Spheroids were obtained by means of the traditional cell aggregation technique resulting in a 3D model characterized by high cell density and low amount of extracellular proteins. The microtissues were obtained by culturing cells into porous gelatin microscaffolds. In this latter configuration, cells assembled an intricate network of collagen, fibronectin and hyaluronic acid. We investigated the biophysical properties of both 3D models in terms of cell growth, metabolic activity, texture and composition of the extracellular matrix (via histological analysis and multiphoton imaging) and cell mechanical properties (via Particle Tracking Microrheology). In the spheroid models such biophysical properties remained unchanged regardless to the cell type used. In contrast, normal-microtissues and cancer-activated-microtissues displayed marked differences. CAF-microtissues possessed higher proliferation rate, superior contraction capability, different micro-rheological properties and an extracellular matrix richer in collagen fibronectin and hyaluronic acid. At last, multiphoton investigation revealed differences in the collagen network architecture. Taken together, these results suggested that despite to cell spheroids, microtissues better recapitulate the important differences existing in vivo between normal and cancer-activated stroma representing a more suitable system to mimic in vitro the stromal element of the tumor tissues. Statement of Significance This work concerns the engineering of tumor tissue in vitro. Tumor models serve as biological equivalent to study pathologic progression and to screen or validate the drugs efficacy. Tumor tissue is composed by malignant cells surviving in a microenvironment, or stroma. Stroma plays a pivotal role in cancer progression. Current in vitro models, i.e. spheroids, can't replicate the phenomena related to the tumor stroma remodeling. For this reason, to better replicate the tumor physiology in vitro that include functional and morphological changes, a novel 3D cancer model is proposed.",

            "abstract": "© 2017 The Author(s). Immunotherapy efficacy relies on the crosstalk within the tumor microenvironment between cancer and dendritic cells (DCs) resulting in the induction of a potent and effective antitumor response. DCs have the specific role of recognizing cancer cells, taking up tumor antigens (Ags) and then migrating to lymph nodes for Ag (cross)-presentation to naïve T cells. Interferon-α-conditioned DCs (IFN-DCs) exhibit marked phagocytic activity and the special ability of inducing Ag-specific T-cell response. Here, we have developed a novel microfluidic platform recreating tightly interconnected cancer and immune systems with specific 3D environmental properties, for tracking human DC behaviour toward tumor cells. By combining our microfluidic platform with advanced microscopy and a revised cell tracking analysis algorithm, it was possible to evaluate the guided efficient motion of IFN-DCs toward drug-Treated cancer cells and the succeeding phagocytosis events. Overall, this platform allowed the dissection of IFN-DC-cancer cell interactions within 3D tumor spaces, with the discovery of major underlying factors such as CXCR4 involvement and underscored its potential as an innovative tool to assess the efficacy of immunotherapeutic approaches.",

            "abstract": "© 2017 Acta Materialia Inc. Therapeutic approaches based on nanomedicine have garnered great attention in cancer research. In vitro biological models that better mimic in vivo conditions are crucial tools to more accurately predict their therapeutic efficacy in vivo. In this work, a new 3D breast cancer microtissue has been developed to recapitulate the complexity of the tumor microenvironment and to test its efficacy as screening platform for drug delivery systems. The proposed 3D cancer model presents human breast adenocarcinoma cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts embedded in their own ECM, thus showing several features of an in vivo tumor, such as overexpression of metallo-proteinases (MMPs). After demonstrating at molecular and protein level the MMP2 overexpression in such tumor microtissues, we used them to test a recently validated formulation of endogenous MMP2-responsive nanoparticles (NP). The presence of the MMP2-sensitive linker allows doxorubicin release from NP only upon specific enzymatic cleavage of the peptide. The same NP without the MMP-sensitive linker and healthy breast microtissues were also produced to demonstrate NP specificity and selectivity. Cell viability after NP treatment confirmed that controlled drug delivery is achieved only in 3D tumor microtissues suggesting that the validation of therapeutic strategies in such 3D tumor model could predict human response. Statement of Significance: A major issue of modern cancer research is the development of accurate and predictive experimental models of human tumors consistent with tumor microenvironment and applicable as screening platforms for novel therapeutic strategies. In this work, we developed and validated a new 3D microtissue model of human breast tumor as a testing platform of anti-cancer drug delivery systems. To this aim, biodegradable nanoparticles responsive to physiological changes specifically occurring in tumor microenvironment were used. Our findings clearly demonstrate that the breast tumor microtissue well recapitulates in vivo physiological features of tumor tissue and elicits a specific response to microenvironmentally-responsive nanoparticles compared to healthy tissue. We believe this study is of particular interest for cancer research and paves the way to exploit tumor microtissues for several testing purposes.",

            "abstract": "© 2017 The British Pharmacological Society. Background and Purpose: 5-fluorouracil (5FU) and its prodrug, capecitabine, can damage endothelial cells, whilst endothelial integrity is preserved by glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1). Here, we studied the effect of 5FU on endothelial senescence and whether GLP-1 antagonizes it. Experimental Approach: EA.hy926 cells were exposed to 5FU or sera from patients taking capecitabine, with or without pre-incubation with GLP-1. Senescence was identified by expression of senescence-associated β-galactosidase and p16INK4a and reduced cell proliferation. Soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1), soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1) and CD146 (marker of endothelial injury) were measured by ELISA before and at completion of capecitabine chemotherapy. RT-PCR, western blotting, functional experiments with signalling inhibitors and ERK1/2 silencing were performed to characterize 5FU-induced phenotype and elucidate the pathways underlying 5FU and GLP-1 activity. Key Results: Both 5FU and sera from capecitabine-treated patients stimulated endothelial cell senescence. 5FU-elicited senescence occurred via activation of p38 and JNK, and was associated with decreased eNOS and SIRT-1 levels. Furthermore, 5FU up-regulated VCAM1 and TYMP (encodes enzyme activating capecitabine and 5FU), and sVCAM-1 and CD146 concentrations were higher after than before capecitabine chemotherapy. A non-significant trend for higher ICAM1 levels was also observed. GLP-1 counteracted 5FU-initiated senescence and reduced eNOS and SIRT-1 expression, this protection being mediated by GLP-1 receptor, ERK1/2 and, possibly, PKA and PI3K. Conclusions and Implications: 5FU causes endothelial cell senescence and dysfunction, which may contribute to its cardiovascular side effects. 5FU-triggered senescence was prevented by GLP-1, raising the possibility of using GLP-1 analogues and degradation inhibitors to treat 5FU and capecitabine vascular toxicity.",

            "abstract": "© The Royal Society of Chemistry. In the present study a new, facile and cheap method to obtain a 2D surface-tension-confined fluidic system on substrates conformally coated by parylene C is presented. It is based on the use of poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS)-based soft masks obtained by molds produced by a 3D-printer. These masks, applied alternatively onto a parylene C-coated silicon substrate together with appropriate plasma treatments permit to obtain a superhydrophilic pattern on a superhydrophobic background, in which pure water, water-based solutions and polar solvents can flow. The flow of these liquids is strictly confined and is driven into the superhydrophilic pattern only by the differences in surface energy between it and the background, without any confinement effect provided by walls or capillary-driven channel, that are completely missing. According to the proposed fabrication method, all the desired fluidic systems can be fabricated in an easy and cheap way. The developed method for 2D surface-tension-confined fluidics on parylene C permits to obtain a highly versatile platform which can be applied on all desired substrates, without the need to etch the polymer surface in order to obtain channel walls, paving the way to employ green, easily available and cheaper substrates, such as cellulose for paper-based fluidics applications, improving, at the same time, the biopolymer surface properties.",

Owing to the continuous diffusion of 3D printing driven by low-cost entry-level material extrusion printers, sustainability of a so popular AM technology is of paramount importance. Therefore, recycling 3D printed wastes and 3D parts again at the end of their life is an important issue to be addressed. Research efforts are directed towards the improvement of the biodegradability of 3D printing filaments and the replacement of oil based feedstock with bio-based compostable plastics. The aim of this work is to describe the state of the art about development and use of recycled or biodegradable filaments in 3D printing. Beyond a critical review of the literature, open issues and research opportunities are presented.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 Federation of European Neuroscience Societies and John Wiley &amp; Sons LtdDopamine transporter deficiency syndrome (DTDS) is a novel autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the dopamine transporter (DAT), which leads to the partial or total loss of function of the protein. DTDS is a pharmacoresistant syndrome and very little is known about its neurobiology, in part due to the lack of relevant animal models. The objective of this study was to establish the first animal model for DTDS with strong construct validity, using Caenorhabditis elegans, and to investigate the in vivo role played by DTDS-related mutations found in human DAT (hDAT). We took advantage of a C. elegans knockout for the hDAT orthologue, cedat-1, to obtain genetically humanized animals bearing hDAT, in the wild type and in two mutated forms (399delG and 941C&gt;T), in a null background. In C. elegans transgenic animals expressing the human wild-type form, we observed a rescue of the knockout phenotype, as assessed using two well-established paradigms, known to be regulated by the endogenous uptake of dopamine or 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) by DAT. The less severe mutation (941C&gt;T) was able to partially rescue only one of the knockout phenotypes, whereas the 399delG mutation impaired DAT function in both phenotypic paradigms. Our in vivo phenotypic findings demonstrate a functional conservation between human and nematode DAT and validate previous in vitro indications of the loss of function of hDAT in carriers of DTDS-related mutations. Taken together, these observations establish C. elegans as a novel animal model for fast and inexpensive screening of hDAT mutations in functional and in vivo tests.",

The system is first activated through the conversion of the spiropyran molecules dispersed within the polymer to their fluorescent merocyanine photoisomers upon UV irradiation. The latter undergo protonation in the presence of acid vapors, giving rise to an evident colorimetric transition of the composite from purple to yellow and to a concurrent quenching in the spectral emission. Upon gas depletion under ambient conditions, the reversible interactions with the acid molecules lead to a spontaneous recovery of the free merocyanine form and, thus, of the initial materials' color and emission signal. Consistent with their higher surface to volume ratio, the nanofibrous mats exhibit a reduction in the response and recovery times by 25% and by more than 90% compared to composite fibers and films of the same material. The efficient vapor permeation/desorption confers a fast optical detection, which is linear with the acid concentration, and an outstanding reusability for over 40 protonation/recovery cycles. Therefore, the photoswitchable acidochromism of spiropyrans combined with the high specific surface area of the nanofibrous polymeric support provides a photoactivated fast optical and visual acid recognition suitable for integration within portable and reusable platforms targeting the real-time detection of acidic vapors for industrial and environmental applications.",

            "abstract": "© 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature. Terahertz (THz) fields are widely used for sensing, communication and quality control. In future applications, they could be efficiently confined, enhanced and manipulated well below the classical diffraction limit through the excitation of graphene plasmons (GPs). These possibilities emerge from the strongly reduced GP wavelength, λ p, compared with the photon wavelength, λ 0, which can be controlled by modulating the carrier density of graphene via electrical gating. Recently, GPs in a graphene/insulator/metal configuration have been predicted to exhibit a linear dispersion (thus called acoustic plasmons) and a further reduced wavelength, implying an improved field confinement, analogous to plasmons in two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) near conductive substrates. Although infrared GPs have been visualized by scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy (s-SNOM), the real-space imaging of strongly confined THz plasmons in graphene and 2DEGs has been elusive so far - only GPs with nearly free-space wavelengths have been observed. Here we demonstrate real-space imaging of acoustic THz plasmons in a graphene photodetector with split-gate architecture. To that end, we introduce nanoscale-resolved THz photocurrent near-field microscopy, where near-field excited GPs are detected thermoelectrically rather than optically. This on-chip detection simplifies GP imaging as sophisticated s-SNOM detection schemes can be avoided. The photocurrent images reveal strongly reduced GP wavelengths (λ p ≈ λ 0 /66), a linear dispersion resulting from the coupling of GPs with the metal gate below the graphene, and that plasmon damping at positive carrier densities is dominated by Coulomb impurity scattering.",

            "abstract": "© 2015 Cambridge University Press. Legged robots have the potential to navigate in more challenging terrains than wheeled robots. Unfortunately, their control is more demanding, because they have to deal with the common tasks of mapping and path planning as well as more specific issues of legged locomotion, like balancing and foothold planning. In this paper, we present the integration and the development of a stabilized vision system on the fully torque-controlled hydraulically actuated quadruped robot (HyQ). The active head added onto the robot is composed of a fast pan and tilt unit (PTU) and a high-resolution wide angle stereo camera. The PTU enables camera gaze shifting to a specific area in the environment (both to extend and refine the map) or to track an object while navigating. Moreover, as the quadruped locomotion induces strong regular vibrations, impacts or slippages on rough terrain, we took advantage of the PTU to mechanically compensate for the robot's motions. In this paper, we demonstrate the influence of legged locomotion on the quality of the visual data stream by providing a detailed study of HyQ's motions, which are compared against a rough terrain wheeled robot of the same size. Our proposed Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)-based controller allows us to decouple the camera from the robot motions. We show through experiments that, by stabilizing the image feedback, we can improve the onboard vision-based processes of tracking and mapping. In particular, during the outdoor tests on the quadruped robot, the use of our camera stabilization system improved the accuracy on the 3D maps by 25%, with a decrease of 50% of mapping failures.",

Mycelia from two types of edible, medicinal fungi, Ganoderma lucidum and Pleurotus ostreatus, have been carefully cultivated, being fed by two bio-substrates: cellulose and cellulose/potato-dextrose, the second being easier to digest by mycelium due to presence of simple sugars in its composition. After specific growing times the mycelia have been processed in order to cease their growth. Depending on their feeding substrate, the final fibrous structures showed different relative concentrations in polysaccharides, lipids, proteins and chitin. Such differences are reflected as alterations in morphology and mechanical properties. The materials grown on cellulose contained more chitin and showed higher Young's modulus and lower elongation than those grown on dextrose-containing substrates, indicating that the mycelium materials get stiffer when their feeding substrate is harder to digest. All the developed fibrous materials were hydrophobic with water contact angles higher than 120°. The possibility of tailoring mycelium materials' properties by properly choosing their nutrient substrates paves the way for their use in various scale applications.",

            "abstract": "© 2017 Elsevier Ltd We report here the first example of a covalent functional nanocarbon hybrid based on a benchmark metal-free donor-π-acceptor (D-π-A) dye and reduced graphene oxide (RGO). The dyad, prepared by direct arylation of the RGO surface by means of an aniline derivative of the D-π-A species, has been thoroughly characterized in terms of dye loading percentage and spectroscopic properties, in comparison with the reference free dye, pristine RGO, and with an analogous non-covalent dye-RGO hybrid. When used as a photosensitizing agent in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC), the covalent hybrid demonstrated lower photovoltaic performances compared to the cell with the reference dye, a result that was mostly ascribed to the lower dye content of the former. Furthermore, the RGO based sensitizer showed stronger binding to the semiconductor oxide in comparison to the reference dye, paving the way to a new generation of DSSC photoanodes with improved chemical stability. This work demonstrates the full potential of the new class of hybrid sensitizers to equal or even exceed the photovoltaic performances achieved by standard organic photovoltaic sensitizers once molecular engineering of the functional nanocarbon hybrid has been refined.",

In this article, we investigate the convergence properties of a stochastic primal-dual splitting algorithm for solving structured monotone inclusions involving the sum of a cocoercive operator and a composite monotone operator. The proposed method is the stochastic extension to monotone inclusions of a proximal method studied in the literature for saddle point problems. It consists in a forward step determined by the stochastic evaluation of the cocoercive operator, a backward step in the dual variables involving the resolvent of the monotone operator, and an additional forward step using the stochastic evaluation of the cocoercive operator introduced in the first step. We prove weak almost sure convergence of the iterates by showing that the primal-dual sequence generated by the method is stochastic quasi-Fejér-monotone with respect to the set of zeros of the considered primal and dual inclusions. Additional results on ergodic convergence in expectation are considered for the special case of saddle point models.",

Unfortunately, no effective clinical treatments exist for the majority of retinal degenerative disorders. Here we report on the fabrication and functional validation of a fully organic prosthesis for long-term in vivo subretinal implantation in the eye of Royal College of Surgeons rats, a widely recognized model of retinitis pigmentosa. Electrophysiological and behavioural analyses reveal a prosthesis-dependent recovery of light sensitivity and visual acuity that persists up to 6–10 months after surgery. The rescue of the visual function is accompanied by an increase in the basal metabolic activity of the primary visual cortex, as demonstrated by positron emission tomography imaging. Our results highlight the possibility of developing a new generation of fully organic, highly biocompatible and functionally autonomous photovoltaic prostheses for subretinal implants to treat degenerative blindness.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 American Chemical Society. Hitherto, great strides have been made in the development of organic systems that exhibit triplet-triplet annihilation-induced photonenergy upconversion (TTA-UC). Yet, the exact role of intermolecular states in solid-state TTA-UC composites remains elusive. Here we perform a comprehensive spectroscopic study in a series of solution-processable solidstate TTA-UC organic composites with increasing segregated phase content for elucidating the impact of aggregate formation in their TTA-UC properties. Six different states of aggregation are reached in composites of the 9,10-diphenylanthracene (DPA) blue emitter mixed with the (2,3,7,8,12,13,17,18-octaethylporphyrinato)platinum(II) sensitizer (PtOEP) in a fixed nominal ratio (2 wt % PtOEP). Fine-tuning of the PtOEP and DPA phase segregation in these composites is achieved with a lowtemperature solution-processing protocol when three different solvents of increasing boiling point are alternatively used and when the binary DPA:PtOEP system is dispersed in the optically inert polystyrene (PS) matrix (PS:DPA:PtOEP). Time-gated (in the nanosecond and microsecond time scales) photoluminescence measurements identify the upper level of PtOEP segregation at which the PtOEP aggregate-based networks favor PtOEP triplet exciton migration toward the PtOEP:DPA interfaces and triplet energy transfer to the DPA triplet manifold. The maximum DPA TTA-UC luminescence intensity is ensured when the bimolecular annihilation constant of PtOEP remains close to γTTA-PtOEP = 1.1 × 10-13 cm3 s-1. Beyond this PtOEP segregation level, the DPA TTA-UC luminescence intensity decreases because of losses caused by the generation of PtOEP delayed fluorescence and DPA phosphorescence in the nanosecond and microsecond time scales, respectively.",

Previous studies investigating brain networks in MDD during the performance of a task have yielded inconsistent results with the function of the brain at rest. In this study, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging at rest and during a goal-directed task to investigate dynamics of functional connectivity in 19 unmedicated patients with MDD and 19 healthy controls across both experimental paradigms. Patients had spatial differences in the default mode network (DMN), in the executive network (EN), and in the dorsal attention network (DAN) compared to controls at rest and during task performance. In patients the amplitude of the low frequency (LFO) oscillations was reduced in the motor and in the DAN networks during both paradigms. There was a diagnosis by paradigm interaction on the LFOs amplitude of the salience network, with increased amplitude change between task and rest in patients relative to controls. Our findings suggest that the function of several networks could be intrinsically affected in MDD and this could be viable phenotype for the investigation on the neurobiological mechanisms of this disorder and its treatment.",

            "abstract": "© 2017 The Authors Alternative splicing of pre-mRNAs is prominent in the mammalian brain, where it is thought to expand proteome diversity. For example, alternative splicing of voltage-gated Ca2+ channel (VGCC) α1 subunits can generate thousands of isoforms with differential properties and expression patterns. However, the impact of this molecular diversity on brain function, particularly on synaptic transmission, which crucially depends on VGCCs, is unclear. Here, we investigate how two major splice isoforms of P/Q-type VGCCs (Cav2.1[EFa/b]) regulate presynaptic plasticity in hippocampal neurons. We find that the efficacy of P/Q-type VGCC isoforms in supporting synaptic transmission is markedly different, with Cav2.1[EFa] promoting synaptic depression and Cav2.1[EFb] synaptic facilitation. Following a reduction in network activity, hippocampal neurons upregulate selectively Cav2.1[EFa], the isoform exhibiting the higher synaptic efficacy, thus effectively supporting presynaptic homeostatic plasticity. Therefore, the balance between VGCC splice variants at the synapse is a key factor in controlling neurotransmitter release and presynaptic plasticity.",

            "abstract": "© The Royal Society of Chemistry.Recent developments in the design and synthesis of donor-acceptor semiconducting copolymers have significantly contributed to improve the ambipolar transport properties of polymer field-effect transistors (FETs). The further development of such FETs towards real applications would greatly benefit from the knowledge of the specific charge distribution along the channel, especially in the ambipolar regime. Here we accomplish this task by adopting charge modulation spectroscopy (CMS) and microscopy (CMM), electro-optical spectroscopy techniques which allow us to probe in situ charge induced features in the transmission spectra of conjugated polymers, to study a model high mobility donor-acceptor co-polymer (DPPT-TT, poly(N-alkyldiketopyrrolo-pyrrole dithienylthieno[3,2-b]thiophene)). Thanks to the sub-micrometer spatial resolution of confocal microscopy, we are able to isolate the specific contribution of channel and electrode regions which are superimposed in the macroscopic CMS spectra, thus allowing the mapping of hole and electron distributions across the active channel in both unipolar and ambipolar operating regimes. Our findings illustrate the use of a local probe in charge-modulation experiments to correctly assign spectral features and to determine the distributions of positive and negative charge carriers in an operating device, which has relevant implications on the understanding of the nature of charge transport in high-mobility ambipolar semiconducting polymers.",

            "abstract": "© 2017 The Mineralogical Society. In the manganesiferous ores associated with the metacherts of the ophiolitic sequences at the Cerchiara mine, Eastern Liguria (Italy), a new Mn-bearing mineral belonging to the mica group has been recently found and characterized. High resolution transmission electron microscopy and electron diffraction tomography studies confirm that the mineral belongs to the mica group. Unit-cell parameters from the powder diffraction pattern are: a = 5.149(1), b = 8.915(1), c = 10.304(1) Å, β = 102.03(1)°, space group C2 or C2/m. On the basis of the electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopic results, the Mn4+ content represents a very subordinate fraction of the total Mn, the remaining occurring as Mn3+. The Raman spectrum clearly indicates the presence of OH groups in the structure. Laser-ablation inductively-coupled-plasma mass-spectrometry measurements assess the presence of considerable amounts of Li. Assuming all Mn as Mn3+ and 22 negative charges, the empirical formula can be expressed as: (K0.83□0.17)(Mn3+ 1.14Mg0.80Li0.20Fe3+ 0.02)(Si3.89Al0.10)O10[(OH)1.92F0.08] with the sum of the octahedral cations indicating a 'transitional' character between a di- and a tri-octahedral structure. This formula corresponds ideally to the Mn3+ analogue of celadonite, thus expanding the range of solid solution in the celadonite family. The ideal end-member formula KMn3+MgSi4O10(OH)2 can be easily related to celadonite by the homovalent substitution VIMn3+ → VIFe3+. The mineral and its name have been approved by the Commission on New Minerals, Nomenclature and Classification of the International Mineralogical Association, (IMA 2015-052).",

The use of small molecule kinase inhibitors and their application in combinatorial regimens represent an approach to personalized targeted cancer therapy. A number of AGC kinases, including atypical Protein Kinase C enzymes (PKCs), are validated drug targets for cancer treatment. Most drug development programs for protein kinases focus on the development of drugs that bind at the ATP-binding site. Alternatively, allosteric drugs have great potential for the development of future innovative drugs. However, the rational development of allosteric drugs poses important challenges because the compounds not only must bind to a given site but also must stabilize forms of the protein with a desired effect at a distant site. Here we describe the development of a new class of compounds targeting a regulatory site (PIF-pocket) present in the kinase domain and provide biochemical and crystallographic data showing that these compounds allosterically inhibit the activity of atypical PKCs. PS432, a representative compound, decreased the rate of proliferation of non-small cell lung cancer cells more potently than aurothiomalate, an atypical PKC inhibitor currently under evaluation in clinical trials, and significantly reduced tumor growth without side effects in a mouse xenograft model. The druglike chemical class provides ample possibilities for the synthesis of derivative compounds, with the potential to allosterically modulate the activity of atypical PKCs and other kinases.",

There is a growing interest for developing organotypic cervical models by using primary cervical cells that are able to reproduce the physiological relevant stromal microenvironment and the distinctive histology of the native cervical epithelium. Here for the first time it is reported the production of an organotypic cervical model featured by a scaffold-free stromal tissue resembling the extracellular matrix (ECM) composition and organization of the native counterpart as well as a completely well-differentiated epithelium. To reach this aim, human cervical microtissue precursors have been produced, characterized, and used as functional building units to fabricate a cell-synthesized cervical stroma equivalent by means of a bottom-up approach. Immunotypization, and molecular and morphological analyses reveal the extent of fundamental epithelial biomarkers and the presence of collagen and noncollagenous molecules, demonstrating that the natural tissue architecture and biological characteristics of cervical tissues are reproduced. The results of this study suggest that the bottom-up technology used to produce these 3D human cervical equivalents provides a fully functional organotypic cervical model that may be used as a valuable tool to investigate the epithelial-stromal interactions as well as for testing new therapeutics in vitro.",

The output of this characterization can then be exploited to drive the design of numerical models, which can be used to investigate in depth the mechanisms of human sensing. In this work, we present a novel integrated measurement technique and experimental set up for in vivo characterization of the deformation of the human fingertip at contact, in terms of contact area, force, deformation, and pressure distribution. The device presented here compresses the participant's fingertip against a flat surface, while the aforementioned measurements are acquired and experimental parameters such as velocity, finger orientation, and displacement (indentation) controlled. Experimental outcomes are then compared and integrated with the output of a 3D finite element (FE) model of the human fingertip, built upon existing validated models. The agreement between numerical and experimental data represents a validation for our approach.",

Such functions are mechanically demanding, and replacement constructs used in meniscus repair often fail because of a poor match with the surrounding tissue. This study focused on the native structure-mechanics relationships and on their anisotropic behavior in meniscus, to define the target biomechanical viscoelastic properties required by scaffolds upon loading. METHODS: To show regional orientation of the collagen fibers and their viscoelastic behavior, bovine lateral menisci were characterized by second harmonic generation microscopy and through time-dependent mechanical tests. Furthermore, their dynamic viscoelastic response was analyzed over a wide range of frequencies. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Multilevel characterization aims to expand the biomimetic approach from the structure itself, to include the mechanical characteristics that give the meniscus its peculiar properties, thus providing tools for the design of novel, effective scaffolds. An example of modeling of anisotropic open-cell porous material tailored to fulfill the measured requirements is presented, leading to a definition of additional parameters for a better understanding of the load transmission mechanism and for better scaffold functionality.",

In particular, as-grown amorphous NTs were compared to crystalline anatase nanostructures, obtained following two different procedures, namely thermal and vapor-induced crystallizations. The catalytic activity of these materials toward the ORR was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry measurements. ORR polarization curves, combined with the rotating disk technique, indicated a predominant four-electrons reduction path, especially for crystalline samples. The effect of the structural characteristics of the investigated materials on the catalytic activity was analyzed in details by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The catalytic performance of the crystalline NTs is only slightly lower with respect to the reference material for fuel cell applications, namely platinum, but is in line with other cost-effective catalysts recently proposed in the literature. However, if compared to the larger part of these low-cost catalysts, anodically-grown TiO2 NTs are characterized by a synthesis route which is highly reproducible and easily up-scalable.",

In the present paper a derivative obtained by ionic interaction between chitosan and oleic acid was for the first time studied to physically stabilize o/w nanoemulsions of an antimicrobial essential oil, Cymbopogon citratus (Lemongrass), in a low energy and mild conditions emulsification process. The novel combination of spontaneous emulsification process with chitosan oleate amphiphilic properties resulted in a stable dispersion of a few hundred nanometer droplets. Positive zeta potential confirmed the presence of a chitosan shell around the oil droplets, which is responsible for the nanoemulsion physical stabilization and for the maintenance of chitosan bioactive properties, such as mucoadhesion. Cytotoxicity test was performed on four different cell lines (HEp-2, Caco-2, WKD and McCoy cells) showing biocompatibility of the system. The maintenance and in some cases even a clear improvement in the essential oil antimicrobial activity towards nine bacterial and ten fungal strains, all of clinical relevance was verified for Lemongrass nanoemulsion.",

Several studies on visually guided reach-to-grasp movements have documented that how objects are grasped differs depending on the actions one intends to perform subsequently. However, no previous study has examined whether this differential grasping may also occur without visual input. In this study, we used motion capture technology to investigate the influence of visual feedback and prior visual experience on the modulation of kinematics by intention in sighted (in both full-vision and no-vision conditions), early-blind and late-blind participants. Results provide evidence of modulation of kinematics by intention to a similar degree under both full-vision and no-vision conditions. Moreover, they demonstrate that prior visual experience has little impact on the tailoring of grasping movements to intention. This suggests that sequential action planning does not depend on visual input, and may instead be ascribed to the function of multisensory-motor cortical network that operates and develops not only in light, but also in darkness.",

Intrathecal drug and gene vector delivery is a procedure to release a solute within the cerebrospinal fluid. This procedure is currently used in clinical practice and shows promise for treatment of several central nervous system pathologies. However, intrathecal delivery protocols and systems are not yet optimized. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of injection parameters on solute distribution within the cervical subarachnoid space using a numerical platform. We developed a numerical model based on a patient-specific three dimensional geometry of the cervical subarachnoid space with idealized dorsal and ventral nerve roots and denticulate ligament anatomy. We considered the drug as massless particles within the flow field and with similar properties as the CSF, and we analyzed the effects of anatomy, catheter position, angle and injection flow rate on solute distribution within the cerebrospinal fluid by performing a series of numerical simulations. Results were compared quantitatively in terms of drug peak concentration, spread, accumulation rate and appearance instant over 15 seconds following the injection. Results indicated that solute distribution within the cervical spine was altered by all parameters investigated within the time range analyzed following the injection. The presence of spinal cord nerve roots and denticulate ligaments increased drug spread by 60% compared to simulations without these anatomical features. Catheter position and angle were both found to alter spread rate up to 86%, and catheter flow rate altered drug peak concentration up to 78%. The presented numerical platform fills a first gap towards the realization of a tool to parametrically assess and optimize intrathecal drug and gene vector delivery protocols and systems. Further investigation is needed to analyze drug spread over a longer clinically relevant time frame.",

Analogously, we implement soft bending capabilities in our robotic roots by designing and integrating soft spring-based actuation (SSBA) systems using helical springs to transmit the motor power in a compliant manner. Each robotic tip integrates four different sensors, including customised flexible touch and innovative humidity sensors together with commercial gravity and temperature sensors.

In scanning electron microscopy (SEM), a highly energetic and focused electron beam scans the sample and normally provides an extremely enlarged image of the morphology of the sample, as well as information on its chemical composition using an energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) detector. SEM-EDS is mainly used for characterization of materials, but lately its application has been extended to study organic-based specimens, such as biological samples and polymers.Microplastics are hazardous materials produced not only directly by anthropogenic activities but also as a resulting product of macroplastics degradation. Pollution due to release of micro/nanoplastics into the environment and their ecological consequences are nowadays subject of extended scientific research. Consequently, the demand of dedicated techniques for the assessment of morphology and chemical nature of such polymer-based materials is of utmost importance.This chapter highlights the recent application of SEM-EDS for the characterization of microplastics as emergent pollutants. SEM-EDS is an advanced imaging and analytical technique that effortlessly copes with the urgent need for the characterization of such waste products as well as the other toxic substances that may be adsorbed by microplastics. The prominence of electron microscopy coupled with analytical detectors, particularly SEM-EDS, in the identification and determination of morphology of micro/nanoplastics can undoubtedly be established.",

The ROC can be calibrated to null the parasitic effects of transducer variation due to physical assembly. A prototype is fabricated in a 130 nm RFCMOS process, with an active area of 221×79μm2 and 1.84 μ W power consumption at VDD=1.2V and 1ms read-out rate. The ROC output is robust to VDD and temperature variations in a range |Δ VDD|≤ 20% and (25-53) °C. Furthermore, it can provide up to 200m Vpp power supply sine wave rejection in the range 50Hz-5MHz at VDD=1.1V , for an output standard deviation lower than one LSB. Owing to its features and its digital modularity, the ROC was co-designed with a scalable and modular Multi-Walled Carbon NanoTube (MW-CNT) Nano composite transducer, to achieve tunable output sensitivity by adjusting the sensor nominal capacitance and the reference capacitance. The maximum sensitivity of 5.23 fF per LSB was reached when both match. The ROC was then validated with the MW-CNT nanocomposite sensor which exhibits a piecewise behaviour. 5.3 and 7.1 ENOB were extrapolated in the low-load and medium-load regions, respectively. Besides the major advantage of tunable sensitivity, the presented ROC features the lowest acquisition time and one of the most compact sizes among the state-of-the-art ROCs. Moreover, process voltage and temperature (PVT) robust output and ultra-low power consumption make this solution very attractive to replicate human physiology at robotic-level.",

Originally designed to assess cognitive deficits relevant to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, it has been widely used in the investigation of neural systems of attention. In the current study, we have set up a modified version, which reduced the training phase to only 8–9 days with minimal food deprivation and without single-housing. Furthermore, based on evidence that patients with schizophrenia are more impaired in broad monitoring abilities than in sustained attention, we successfully developed a protocol replicating the Spatial Attentional Resource Allocation Task (SARAT), used in humans to assess broad monitoring. During this task, when the target appeared at a single pre-cued location, mice selectively responded faster. Instead, increasing the number of validly cued locations proportionately decreased accuracy. We then validated a protocol which is relevant for neuropsychiatric disorders in which additional irrelevant pre-cue lights selectively disrupted attention (distractibility). Finally, we improved previously used protocols changing inter-trial intervals from 5 to 7 s by randomly presenting this shift only in 20% of the trials. This resulted in a selective effect on premature responses (impulsivity), with important implications for schizophrenia as well as for other mental disorders. Therefore, this revised 5-CSRTT reduced training and stress on the animals while selectively measuring different cognitive functions with translational validity to schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders.",

Recently, we developed a bubbling reactor along with its modelling, and we used it with the aforementioned photosystem to measure the actual rate of reaction (RO2) over time. In the present work, the same method is employed to investigate the kinetics of the reaction occurring through several steps, i.e. not only water oxidation, but also parasitic reactions due to chemical instability of the intermediate [Ru(bpy)3]3+ species, which degrade over time finally decreasing the reaction rate. O2 evolution as catalyzed by Mn2O3 is examined at three irradiance conditions, and for three different catalyst contents. Qualitatively, whereas the increase of catalyst amount yields the expected increase of O2 production and evolution rate, the increase in irradiance enhances the degradation processes, thus giving a “paradoxical” effect of decreasing the chemical yields. Chemical kinetics are applied, and predictions are compared to experimental data derived from bubbling-reactor. The development of the kinetic model imposing steady state condition on transient species yields as expression of RO2 a simple linear combination of two exponentials. It is found that the main activity indicators obtained from the bubbling reactor tests can be related in an expression that is independent of the amount catalytic sites, i.e. the ratio between the O2 evolution rate and the total amount of O2 evolved during the reaction. Results show that the ratio between the kinetic constants of the desired (i.e. O2 formation) and undesired path (i.e. dye degradation) decreases at increasing irradiance, evidencing how the role of parasitic reactions, far from being negligible, tends to be overwhelming.",

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Multiple formulations of iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) have been proposed for enhancing contrast in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and for increasing efficacy in thermal ablation therapies. However, insufficient accumulation at the disease site and low magnetic performance hamper the clinical application of IONPs. Here, 20 nm iron oxide nanocubes were assembled into larger nanoconstructs externally stabilized by a serum albumin coating. The resulting assemblies of nanocubes (ANCs) had an average diameter of 100 nm and exhibited transverse relaxivity (r2 = 678.9 ± 29.0 mM‒1·s‒1 at 1.41 T) and heating efficiency (specific absorption rate of 109.8 ± 12.8 W·g‒1 at 512 kHz and 10 kA·m‒1). In mice bearing glioblastoma multiforme tumors, Cy5.5-labeled ANCs allowed visualization of malignant masses via both near infrared fluorescent and magnetic resonance imaging. Also, upon systemic administration of ANCs (5 mgFe·kg‒1), 30 min of daily exposure to alternating magnetic fields for three consecutive days was sufficient to halt tumor progression. This study demonstrates that intravascular administration of ANCs can effectively visualize and treat neoplastic masses.",

Decellularized matrices are steadily gaining popularity to study the biology of cells and tissues, as they represent a biomimetic environment in which cells can recapitulate certain behaviours that share similarities with those observed in vivo. Basically, biochemistry, microstructure and mechanics of the decellularized matrices are the most valuable properties that differentiate these culturing systems from conventional bidimensional models. Several procedures to decellularize tissues have been proposed so far, with the common aim to preserve the tissue chemical/physical properties of the original tissue. However, these processes are complex, time-consuming and expensive. In this work, we propose a cost-effective, easy-to-produce decellularized dermal matrix, derived from animal skin. The chemical/physical processes to obtain the matrices proved to not alter matrix structure and did not induce cytotoxicity issues. To test the validity of the decellularized matrices as a model to study the behaviour of tumour cells in vitro, we performed microstructural and mechanical investigations as well as cell proliferation assays. In particular, three different tumour cell lines were used, which proliferated and invaded the matrix with no additional treatments. Decellularized skin scaffold, presented in this work, could be a strong competitor for conventional 3D systems like synthetic porous scaffolds or hydrogels.",

Core clock genes, such as Bmal1, are expressed in SCN neurons and in other brain cells, such as astrocytes. However, the role of astrocytic clock genes in controlling rhythmic behaviour is unknown. Here we show that ablation of Bmal1 in GLAST-positive astrocytes alters circadian locomotor behaviour and cognition in mice. Specifically, deletion of astrocytic Bmal1 has an impact on the neuronal clock through GABA signalling. Importantly, pharmacological modulation of GABAA-receptor signalling completely rescues the behavioural phenotypes. Our results reveal a crucial role of astrocytic Bmal1 for the coordination of neuronal clocks and propose a new cellular target, astrocytes, for neuropharmacology of transient or chronic perturbation of circadian rhythms, where alteration of astrocytic clock genes might contribute to the impairment of the neurobehavioural outputs such as cognition.",

The building parameters were optimised to reduce the porosity values. Samples produced with the optimised process parameters were then characterized in terms of microstructures and hardness. The results show that even if some Al3Ni agglomerates were found, the SLM allows a good dispersion of the nickel within the alloy.

            "abstract": "© 2017 Elsevier Inc. Histone posttranslational modifications (hPTMs) generate a complex combinatorial code that plays a critical role in the regulation of gene activity and nuclear architecture during physiological and pathological processes. Mass spectrometry (MS) offers an unbiased, comprehensive, and quantitative view on hPTM patterns, and has emerged as a powerful tool in epigenetic research. Stable isotope labeling by amino acid in cell culture (SILAC) is a MS-based quantitative method that relies on the metabolic labeling of cell populations, which has been widely applied in global proteomic studies and can also be exploited for the accurate quantitation of hPTM changes among distinct functional states. However, the classical SILAC strategy has two main limits: it cannot be applied to more than three cell populations at the time and excludes samples that cannot be metabolically labeled, such as clinical samples. These limitations can be overcome by using a super-SILAC strategy, where a mix of heavy-labeled cell lines is used as a spike-in to analyze any types of samples with high accuracy and high multiplexing capabilities. In this chapter, we will provide a detailed description of a protocol to set up a histone-focused super-SILAC strategy and exploit it to accurately profile hPTMs across multiple samples. As a case study, we will describe a breast cancer-focused super-SILAC approach, which we used in a recent publication to profile hPTMs in frozen and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded human samples, revealing previously unknown marks that differentiate breast cancer subtypes.",

A literature review is performed on their control, covering both free-space and constrained motions of serial and parallel manipulators. Stability-guaranteed control system design is the primary requirement for all control systems. Thus, this paper pays special attention to such systems. An objective evaluation of the effectiveness of different methods and the state of the art in a given field is one of the cornerstones of scientific research and progress. For this purpose, the maximum position tracking error |e|max and a performance indicator ρ (the ratio of |e|max with respect to the maximum velocity) are used to evaluate and benchmark different free-space control methods in the literature. These indicators showed that stability-guaranteed nonlinear model based control designs have resulted in the most advanced control performance. In addition to stable closed-loop control, lack of energy efficiency is another significant challenge in hydraulic robotic systems. This paper pays special attention to these challenges in hydraulic robotic systems and discusses their reciprocal contradiction. Potential solutions to improve the system energy efficiency without control performance deterioration are discussed. Finally, for hydraulic robotic systems, open problems are defined and future trends are projected.",

However, deaf children with restored audition showed similar thresholds for audio and visual thresholds and some evidence of gain in audio-visual temporal multisensory conditions. Interestingly, we found a strong correlation between auditory weighting of multisensory signals and quality of language: patients who gave more weight to audition had better language skills.

            "abstract": "© 2017 Finocchietti, Cappagli and Gori.Blind individuals show impairments for auditory spatial skills that require complex spatial representation of the environment. We suggest that this is partially due to the egocentric frame of reference used by blind individuals. Here we investigate the possibility of reducing the mentioned auditory spatial impairments with an audio-motor training. Our hypothesis is that the association between a motor command and the corresponding movement's sensory feedback can provide an allocentric frame of reference and consequently help blind individuals in understanding complex spatial relationships. Subjects were required to localize the end point of a moving sound before and after either 2-min of audio-motor training or a complete rest. During the training, subjects were asked to move their hand, and consequently the sound source, to freely explore the space around the setup and the body. Both congenital blind (N = 20) and blindfolded healthy controls (N = 28) participated in the study. Results suggest that the audio-motor training was effective in improving space perception of blind individuals. The improvement was not observed in those subjects that did not perform the training. This study demonstrates that it is possible to recalibrate the auditory spatial representation in congenital blind individuals with a short audio-motor training and provides new insights for rehabilitation protocols in blind people.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 IEEE. Homeostatic plasticity is a stabilizing mechanism that allows neural systems to maintain their activity around a functional operating point. This is an extremely useful mechanism for neuromorphic computing systems, as it can be used to compensate for chronic shifts, for example due to changes in the network structure. However, it is important that this plasticity mechanism operates on time scales that are much longer than conventional synaptic plasticity ones, in order to not interfere with the learning process. In this paper we present a novel ultra-low leakage cell and an automatic gain control scheme that can adapt the gain of analog log-domain synapse circuits over extremely long time scales. To validate the proposed scheme, we implemented the ultra-low leakage cell in a standard 180 nm Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) process, and integrated it in an array of dynamic synapses connected to an adaptive integrate and fire neuron. We describe the circuit and demonstrate how it can be configured to scale the gain of all synapses afferent to the silicon neuron in a way to keep the neuron's average firing rate constant around a set operating point. The circuit occupies a silicon area of 84 μm× 22 μm and consumes approximately 10.8 nW with a 1.8 V supply voltage. It exhibits time constants of up to 25 kilo-seconds, thanks to a controllable leakage current that can be scaled down to 1.2 atto-Amps (7.5 electrons/s).",

The details of the entire process are disclosed, from the photolithography processes to the electrodepositing step, and a model for electrical contact was designed. Design/methodology/approach -The localized Cu growth of high aspect ratio (AR) microstructures was obtained through an SU-8 photolithography by exploiting the optimal adhesion on the silicon surface and the possibility of generating thick layers with a single spun process Findings -The experimental results showed an unexpected behaviour that is theoretically explained in detail considering the energy band theory. The obtained geometries showed a remarkable 6:1 AR without any adhesion problem. The non-invasive front-side manipulation represents a noteworthy improvement and simplification for the design of a multi-step production process. Originality/value -An alternative technological approach, called back plate electroplating, has been carried out to obtain Cu growth on the front side of a standard n-Type Si wafer through a back side electrical contact. This technique was then applied to fabricate a master for hot-embossing in a LIGA (Lithographie, Galvanoformung, Abformung)-like process flow. For this purpose, an SU-8 thick mask on a standard n-doped wafer was used. Finally, by using this process, it was possible to obtain high AR Cu geometries, avoiding any complex designing and patterning of the contacts on the front side and thus ensuring good adhesion of the SU-8.",

            "abstract": "© The Royal Society of Chemistry. We studied the oscillator strength fgap of the band gap transition in heteronanocrystals (hNCs) with a spherical CdSe core embedded in an elongated CdS shell. A comparison with fgap of core-only CdSe NCs confirmed a reduction of the electron-hole overlap in hNCs with a band gap larger than 2.05 eV or smaller than 1.98 eV. However, the decrease in fgap is limited to about 50% when compared to CdSe NCs, suggesting that residual confinement still localizes the electron near the core. We correlated fgap with the radiative lifetime obtained from multiexponential photoluminescence (PL) decay traces. The different components were attributed to radiative decay, or deep and shallow carrier trapping, respectively, using the PL quantum efficiency (QE) as a guideline. Our data highlight the challenges associated when extracting the radiative decay, and demonstrate the added value of absorption spectroscopy to obtain the band-edge oscillator strength and the associated radiative recombination rate in colloidal hNCs.",

SBMA is caused by expansions of a polyglutamine tract in the gene coding for androgen receptor (AR). Expression of polyglutamine-expanded AR causes damage to motor neurons and skeletal muscle cells. Here we investigated the effect of β-agonist stimulation in SBMA myotube cells derived from mice and patients, and in knock-in mice. We show that treatment of myotubes expressing polyglutamine-expanded AR with the β-agonist clenbuterol increases their size. Clenbuterol activated the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway and decreased the accumulation of polyglutamine-expanded AR. Treatment of SBMA knock-in mice with clenbuterol, which was started at disease onset, ameliorated motor function and extended survival. Clenbuterol improved muscle pathology, attenuated the glycolytic-to-oxidative metabolic alterations occurring in SBMA muscles and induced hypertrophy of both glycolytic and oxidative fibers. These results indicate that β-agonist stimulation is a novel therapeutic strategy for SBMA.",

Interfaces between conjugated polymers and aqueous electrolytes are gaining increasing interest for a number of different applications, including electrochemical cells, biosensors and functional organic devices for recording and stimulating the bioelectrical activity. In this field, devices sensitive to visible light are particularly interesting, both for inducing solar-driven photo-electrochemical reactions and for spatially selective, not-invasive optical control of living systems. We demonstrate that photoexcitation of the conjugated polymer leads to both capacitive and faradaic electrical signals at the interface with water. We introduce here a mesoporous, light sensitive polymer/electrolyte interface, we characterize its behavior and we reproduce the experimental data with an equivalent circuit model. Interestingly, we show that the use of polymer-based mesoporous devices offers a practical and simple handle for the modulation of the interface behavior. Device engineering allows to control the sign of charges at the polymer surface and to balance faradaic and capacitive currents established at the interface with water. This work opens up interesting opportunities towards applications in both photo-electrochemistry and biology.",

Human PDAC microtissues were obtained by co-culturing pancreatic cancer cells (PT45) and normal or cancer-associated fibroblasts within biodegradable microcarriers in a spinner flask bioreactor. Morphological and histological analyses highlighted that the presence of fibroblasts resulted in the deposition of a stromal matrix rich in collagen leading to the formation of tumor microtissues composed of a heterotypic cell population embedded in their own ECM. We analyzed the modulation of expression of ECM genes and proteins and found that when fibroblasts were co-cultured with PT45, they acquired a myofibroblast phenotype and expressed the desmoplastic reaction markers. This PDAC microtissue, closely recapitulating key PDAC microenvironment characteristics, provides a valuable tool to elucidate the complex stroma–cancer interrelationship and could be used in a future perspective as a testing platform for anticancer drugs in tissue-on-chip technology. Statement of Significance Tumor microenvironment is extremely complex and its organization is due to the interaction between different kind of cells and the extracellular matrix. Tissue engineering could give the answer to the increasing need of 3D culture model that better recapitulate the tumor features at cellular and extracellular level. We aimed in this work at developing a microtissue tumor model by mean of seeding together cancer cells and fibroblasts on gelatin microsphere in order to monitor the crosstalk between the two cell populations and the endogenous extracellular matrix deposition. Results are of particular interest because of the need of heterotypic cancer model that can replicate the complexity of the tumor microenvironment and could be used as drug screening platform.",

In this work, we report a structurally-colored multilayer film made of a silk-based material, inspired by the cuticle of Hoplia coerulea, a species of beetle able to change its color in the presence of moisture. For the generation of interference color, we combined the regenerated silk fibroin, which has a refractive index of 1.55, with a nanocomposite made of silk and titanate nanosheets, a novel 2D material which presents a high refractive index. The multilayer film was fabricated through a layer by layer deposition from the respective water-based solutions by spin coating. The final structure exhibits an interference peak in the transmittance spectrum centered at 400 nm, whose position responds to changes in the relative humidity of the environment. The stimuli-responsive properties of the film were characterized and a simple optical model for the sensing mechanism was proposed. Specifically, the silk-based multilayer showed a reversible color change when exposed to different relative humidities, and good performances in terms of reproducibility and stability over time.",

The applications of plasmonics to energy transfer from free-space radiation to molecules are currently limited to the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum due to the intrinsic optical properties of bulk noble metals that support strong electromagnetic field confinement only close to their plasma frequency in the visible/ultraviolet range. In this work, we show that nanoporous gold can be exploited as a plasmonic material for the mid-infrared region to obtain strong electromagnetic field confinement, co-localized with target molecules into the nanopores and resonant with their vibrational frequency. The effective optical response of the nanoporous metal enables the penetration of optical fields deep into the nanopores, where molecules can be loaded thus achieving a more efficient light-matter coupling if compared to bulk gold. In order to realize plasmonic resonators made of nanoporous gold, we develop a nanofabrication method based on polymeric templates for metal deposition and we obtain antenna arrays resonating at mid-infrared wavelengths selected by design. We then coat the antennas with a thin (3 nm) silica layer acting as the target dielectric layer for optical energy transfer. We study the strength of the light-matter coupling at the vibrational absorption frequency of silica at 1240 cm-1 through the analysis of the experimental Fano lineshape that is benchmarked against identical structures made of bulk gold. The boost in the optical energy transfer from free-space mid-infrared radiation to molecular vibrations in nanoporous 3D nanoantenna arrays can open new application routes for plasmon-enhanced physical-chemical reactions.",

In this work, we developed a new general strategy, which we named \"exocytosis engineering\", to strongly increase the intracellular persistence of nanocarriers and thus the effective dose of transported drugs. The strategy is based on the co-loading of a drug and an exocytosis inhibitor in the nanocarrier, to hinder the high tendency of cells to remove internalized nanocarriers, limiting the pharmacological efficiency of the nanoformulation. In particular, by using a well-known chemotherapeutic drug (doxorubicin) and an efficient exocytosis inhibitor (dimethilamyloride) co-loaded in mesoporous silica nanocarriers, we demonstrated a &gt;6-fold increase in the intracellular dose of the drug (for the same administered dose), achieving a great improvement in its therapeutic action. A strong gain in the cytotoxic effect of the drug was, in fact, observed both in several tumor cell lines and in 3D tumor spheroids. The proposed approach is versatile and broadly applicable to several classes of nanocarriers and drugs, thus opening a fascinating outlook in nanomedicine.",

By selecting and comparing two archetype systems, namely, (NBT)2PbI4 and (EDBE)PbI4 perovskites (NBT = n-butylammonium and EDBE = 2,2-(ethylenedioxy)bis(ethylammonium)), we find that only the latter, subject to larger deformation of the Pb-X bond length and X-Pb-X bond angles, sees the formation of VF color centers whose radiative decay ultimately leads to broadened PL.

Among them, carbonnanotubes emerged as valid candidates not only for drug delivery, but also as a valuable tool in cancerimaging and physical ablation. Nevertheless, deep investigations about carbon nanotubes' potentialbio-compatibility and cytotoxicity limits should be also critically addressed. In the present review,after introducing carbon nanotubes and their promising advantages and drawbacks for fightingcancer, we want to focus on the numerous and different ways in which they can assist to reach thisgoal.

The effects of chemical interactions and the molar ratio of aleuritic acid to the anhydroglucose unit (AGU) of cellulose were investigated. The degree of substitution (DS) of new polymers were characterized by two-dimensional solution-state NMR and ranged from 0.51 to 2.60. The chemical analysis by attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) confirmed the presence of aleuritate groups in the structure induces the formation of new H-bond networks. The tensile analysis and the contact angle measurement confirmed the ductile behavior and the hydrophobicity of the prepared bioplastics. By increasing the aleuritate amounts, the glass transition temperature decreased and the solubility of bioplastic films in most common solvents was improved. Furthermore, this new polymer exhibits similar properties compared to commercial cellulose derivatives.",

Much work has focused on the role of miRNAs, showing in particular that miRNA-mediated regulation can buffer expression noise for lowly expressed genes. Here, using in silico simulations and mathematical modeling, we demonstrate that miRNAs can exert a much broader influence on protein levels by orchestrating competition-induced crosstalk between mRNAs. Most notably, we find that miRNA-mediated cross-talk (i) can stabilize protein levels across the full range of gene expression rates, and (ii) modifies the correlation pattern of co-regulated interacting proteins, changing the sign of correlations from negative to positive. The latter feature may constitute a potentially robust signature of the existence of RNA crosstalk induced by endogenous competition for miRNAs in standard cellular conditions.",

            "abstract": "© 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York. Once activated, some surface receptors promote membrane movements that open new portals of endocytosis, in part to facilitate the internalization of their activated complexes. The prototypic death receptor Fas (CD95/Apo1) promotes a wave of enhanced endocytosis that induces a transient intermixing of endosomes with mitochondria in cells that require mitochondria to amplify death signaling. This initiates a global alteration in membrane traffic that originates from changes in key membrane lipids occurring in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). We have focused the current study on specific lipid changes occurring early after Fas ligation. We analyzed the interaction between endosomes and mitochondria in Jurkat T cells by nanospray-Time-of-flight (ToF) Mass Spectrometry. Immediately after Fas ligation, we found a transient wave of lipid changes that drives a subpopulation of early endosomes to merge with mitochondria. The earliest event appears to be a decrease of phosphatidylcholine (PC), linked to a metabolic switch enhancing phosphatidylinositol (PI) and phosphoinositides, which are crucial for the formation of vacuolar membranes and endocytosis. Lipid changes occur independently of caspase activation and appear to be exacerbated by caspase inhibition. Conversely, inhibition or compensation of PC deficiency attenuates endocytosis, endosome-mitochondria mixing and the induction of cell death. Deficiency of receptor interacting protein, RIP, also limits the specific changes in membrane lipids that are induced by Fas activation, with parallel reduction of endocytosis. Thus, Fas activation rapidly changes the interconversion of PC and PI, which then drives enhanced endocytosis, thus likely propagating death signaling from the cell surface to mitochondria and other organelles.",

A hybrid neuro-robotic architecture was developed, where a biological neuronal network was able to communicate with a small wheeled robot. The robot had to perform an obstacle-avoidance task and every time the robot hits an obstacle, the biological network receives a tetanic stimulation, aimed at strengthening connectivity. Here, we investigated the impact of tetanic stimulation on network activity of hippocampal culture grown on grids of 60 substrate-embedded microelectrode arrays. We found that closed-loop tetanic stimulation produced an enhancement of activity in terms of evoked response, not seen in control and sham (i.e. open-loop tetanic stimulation) experiments. The obtained results demonstrate that activity-dependent interaction with the environment is essential to significantly impact network behavior. Our study constitutes a further step towards the development of neuro-artificial interfaces.",

In this work, IN625 alloy is processed by two different AM processes: selective laser melting (SLM) and laser metal deposition (LMD). First, the different powders are characterized, and then a parameter optimization is performed to obtain the highest possible density (over 99.8%) and hardness, showing very fine microstructures.

We used neutron diffraction to determine the positions of the hydrogen atoms in the ligands aniline and 2-aminopyridine bound to the archetypical serine protease trypsin. The resulting structures show the best resolution so far achieved for proteins larger than 100 residues and allow an accurate description of the protonation states and interactions with nearby water molecules. Despite its low pKa of 4.6 and a large distance of 3.6 Å to the charged Asp189 at the bottom of the S1 pocket, the amino group of aniline becomes protonated, whereas in 2-aminopyridine, the pyridine nitrogen picks up the proton although its amino group is 1.6 Å closer to Asp189. Therefore, apart from charge–charge distances, tautomer stability is decisive for the resulting binding poses, an aspect that is pivotal for predicting correct binding.",

Furthermore, the photocatalytic activity of ZnO, CuO and ZnO-CuO nanostructures was quantified for methylene blue (MB) dye. CuO needles had the lowest photocatalytic activity (23.8% in 40 min). Due to their peculiar forms, ZnO (flower like shape) and ZnO/CuO (leaf like shape where ZnO nanoparticles were deposited) had the highest photocatalytic activity in 40 min (93.6% for ZnO nanoparticles and 95% for ZnO-CuO nanostructures).",

In particular, even if a positive role of chlorine doping on perovskite film formation and on material morphology has been demonstrated, an inherent positive effect on the electronic and photovoltaic properties cannot be excluded. Here we carried out periodic density functional theory and Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics simulations, going down to ∼1% doping, to investigate the effect of chlorine on CH3NH3PbI3. We found that such a small doping has important effects on the dynamics of the crystalline structure, both with respect to the inorganic framework and with respect to the cation libration motion. Together, we observe a dynamic spatial localization of the valence and conduction states in separated spatial material regions, which takes place in the 10-1 ps time scale and which could be the key to ease of exciton dissociation and, likely, to small charge recombination in hybrid perovskites. Moreover, such localization is enhanced by chlorine doping, demonstrating an inherent positive role of chlorine doping on the electronic properties of this class of materials.",

Their biogenesis, which proceeds via a back-splicing reaction, is fairly well characterized, whereas their role in the modulation of physiologically relevant processes is still unclear. Here we performed expression profiling of circRNAs during in vitro differentiation of murine and human myoblasts, and we identified conserved species regulated in myogenesis and altered in Duchenne muscular dystrophy. A high-content functional genomic screen allowed the study of their functional role in muscle differentiation. One of them, circ-ZNF609, resulted in specifically controlling myoblast proliferation. Circ-ZNF609 contains an open reading frame spanning from the start codon, in common with the linear transcript, and terminating at an in-frame STOP codon, created upon circularization. Circ-ZNF609 is associated with heavy polysomes, and it is translated into a protein in a splicing-dependent and cap-independent manner, providing an example of a protein-coding circRNA in eukaryotes.",

We report the colloidal synthesis of ∼5.5 nm inverse spinel-type oxide Ga2FeO4 (GFO) nanocrystals (NCs) with control over the gallium and iron content. As recently theoretically predicted, some classes of spinel-type oxide materials can be intrinsically doped by means of structural disorder and/or change in stoichiometry. Here we show that, indeed, while stoichiometric Ga2FeO4 NCs are intrinsic small bandgap semiconductors, of F-stoichiometric GFO NCs, produced under either Fe-rich or Ga-rich conditions, behave as degenerately doped semiconductors. As a consequence of the generation of free carriers, both Fe-rich and Ga-rich GFO NCs exhibit a localized surface plasmon resonance in the near-infrared at ∼1000 nm, as confirmed by our pump-probe absorption measurements. Noteworthy, the photoelectrochemical characterization of our GFO NCs reveal that the majority carriers are holes in Fe-rich samples, and electrons in Ga-rich ones, highlighting the bipolar nature of this material. The behavior of such off-stoichiometric NCs was explained by our density functional theory calculations as follows: the substitution of Ga3+ by Fe2+ ions, occurring in Fe-rich conditions, can generate free holes (p-type doping), while the replacement of Fe2+ by Ga3+ cations, taking place in Ga-rich samples, produces free electrons (n-type doping). These findings underscore the potential relevance of spinel-type oxides as p-type transparent conductive oxides and as plasmonic semiconductors.",

Polyhemoglobin produced from pure bovine hemoglobin by reaction with PEG bis(N-succynimidil succinate) as a cross-linking agent was encapsulated in gelatin and dehydrated by freeze–drying. Free carboxyhemoglobin and polyhemoglobin microcapsules were characterized by UV–Vis spectroscopy in the absorption range 450–650 nm and cyclic voltammetry in the voltage range from −0.8 to 0.6 mV to evaluate the ability to break the bond with carbon monoxide and to study the carrier’s affinity for oxygen, respectively. SEM used to observe the shape of cross-linked gelatin-polyhemoglobin microparticles showed a regular distribution of globular shapes, with mean size of ~750 nm, which was ascribed to gelatin. Atomic absorption spectroscopy was also performed to detect iron presence in microparticles. Cyclic voltammetry using an Ag–AgCl electrode highlighted characteristic peaks at around −0.6 mV that were attributed to reversible oxygen bonding with iron in oxy-polyhemoglobin structure. These results suggest this technique as a powerful, direct and alternative method to evaluate the extent of hemoglobin oxygenation.",

However, most graph-based methods suffer from a fundamental resolution limit that may have affected previous studies and prevented detection of modules, or \"communities\", that are smaller than a specific scale. Surprise, a resolution-limit-free function rooted in discrete probability theory, has been recently introduced and applied to brain networks, revealing a wide size-distribution of functional modules (Nicolini and Bifone, 2016), in contrast with many previous reports. However, the use of Surprise is limited to binary networks, while brain networks are intrinsically weighted, reflecting a continuous distribution of connectivity strengths between different brain regions. Here, we propose Asymptotical Surprise, a continuous version of Surprise, for the study of weighted brain connectivity networks, and validate this approach in synthetic networks endowed with a ground-truth modular structure. We compare Asymptotical Surprise with leading community detection methods currently in use and show its superior sensitivity in the detection of small modules even in the presence of noise and intersubject variability such as those observed in fMRI data. We apply our novel approach to functional connectivity networks from resting state fMRI experiments, and demonstrate a heterogeneous modular organization, with a wide distribution of clusters spanning multiple scales. Finally, we discuss the implications of these findings for the identification of connector hubs, the brain regions responsible for the integration of the different network elements, showing that the improved resolution afforded by Asymptotical Surprise leads to a different classification compared to current methods.",

An experimentally well-characterized intermolecular proton transfer reaction has been considered as test case. The computed potential energy profiles were analyzed both in the gas phase and in toluene solution, here represented as a polarizable continuum model. The presence of intermolecular (dark) and intramolecular (bright) charge transfer excited states, whose polarity strongly differs along the reaction pathway, makes clear that only subtle compensation between spurious electronic effects—related to the incorrect asymptotic behavior of the functional—and solvent stabilization of polar states leads to the overall correct description of this excited state reaction when using global hybrids with low percentage of Hartree Fock exchange. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 IEEE. A novel solution to compensate hand grasping abilities is proposed for chronic stroke patients. The goal is to provide the patients with a wearable robotic extra-finger that can be worn on the paretic forearm by means of an elastic band. The proposed prototype, the Robotic Sixth Finger, is a modular articulated device that can adapt its structure to the grasped object shape. The extra-finger and the paretic hand act like the two parts of a gripper cooperatively holding an object. We evaluated the feasibility of the approach with four chronic stroke patients performing a qualitative test, the Frenchay Arm Test. In this proof of concept study, the use of the Robotic Sixth Finger has increased the total score of the patients by two points in a five points scale. The subjects were able to perform the two grasping tasks included in the test that were not possible without the robotic extra-finger. Adding a robotic opposing finger is a very promising approach that can significantly improve the functional compensation of the chronic stroke patient during everyday life activities.",

Inhibition of bromodomain and extraterminal motif (BET) proteins such as BRD4 bears great promise for cancer treatment and its efficacy has been frequently attributed to Myc downregulation. Here, we use B-cell tumors as a model to address the mechanism of action of JQ1, a widely used BET inhibitor. Although JQ1 led to widespread eviction of BRD4 from chromatin, its effect on gene transcription was limited to a restricted set of genes. This was unlinked to Myc downregulation or its chromatin association. Yet, JQ1-sensitive genes were enriched for Myc and E2F targets, were expressed at high levels, and showed high promoter occupancy by RNAPol2, BRD4, Myc and E2F. Their marked decrease in transcriptional elongation upon JQ1 treatment, indicated that BRD4-dependent promoter clearance was rate limiting for transcription. At JQ1-insensitive genes the drop in transcriptional elongation still occurred, but was compensated by enhanced RNAPol2 recruitment. Similar results were obtained with other inhibitors of transcriptional elongation. Thus, the selective transcriptional effects following JQ1 treatment are linked to the inability of JQ1-sensitive genes to sustain compensatory RNAPol2 recruitment to promoters. These observations highlight the role of BET proteins in supporting transcriptional elongation and rationalize how a general suppression of elongation may selectively affects transcription.",

Terahertz imaging has the potential to identify and decipher portions of ancient manuscripts, which may be unreadable at infrared and visible wavelengths.

The microscope is based on a continuous-wave solid-state source at 0.3 THz, emitting in the free space with a horn antenna, and a high numerical-aperture ellipsoidal reflector. We present terahertz images with diffraction-limited lateral resolution of approximately 0.5 mm, where the different inks all give similar high contrast. Symbols written on the “verso” side of the parchment, barely glimpsed in the near-infrared photograph, leave a clear imprint in the terahertz images.

Neuromorphic engineering is outside the scopes of this Perspective. Instead, our focus is on those materials and devices featuring genuine physical effects that could be sought as non-linearity, plasticity, excitation, and extinction which could be directly and more naturally coupled with living biological systems. In view of important applications, such as prosthetics and future life augmentation, a cybernetic parallelism is traced, between biological and artificial systems. We will discuss how such intrinsic features could reduce the complexity of conditioning networks for a more natural direct connection between biological and synthetic worlds.

The two basic processes underlying perceptual decisions—how neural responses encode stimuli, and how they inform behavioral choices—have mainly been studied separately. Thus, although many spatiotemporal features of neural population activity, or “neural codes,” have been shown to carry sensory information, it is often unknown whether the brain uses these features for perception. To address this issue, we propose a new framework centered on redefining the neural code as the neural features that carry sensory information used by the animal to drive appropriate behavior; that is, the features that have an intersection between sensory and choice information. We show how this framework leads to a new statistical analysis of neural activity recorded during behavior that can identify such neural codes, and we discuss how to combine intersection-based analysis of neural recordings with intervention on neural activity to determine definitively whether specific neural activity features are involved in a task.",

            "abstract": "© 2017 Elsevier Ltd Stimulant drugs produce reward but also activate stress-responsive systems. The corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and the related hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis stress-responsive systems are activated by stimulant drugs. However, their role in stimulant drug-induced reward remains poorly understood. Herein, we report that CRF1 receptor-deficient (CRF1-/-), but not wild-type, mice show conditioned place preference (CPP) responses to a relatively low cocaine dose (5 mg/kg, i.p.). Conversely, wild-type, but not CRF1-/-, mice display CPP responses to a relatively high cocaine dose (20 mg/kg, i.p.), indicating that CRF1 receptor-deficiency alters the rewarding effects of cocaine. Acute pharmacological antagonism of the CRF1 receptor by antalarmin also eliminates cocaine reward. Nevertheless, CRF1-/- mice display higher stereotypy responses to cocaine than wild-type mice. Despite the very low plasma corticosterone concentration, CRF1-/- mice show higher nuclear glucocorticoid receptor (GR) levels in the brain region of the hippocampus than wild-type mice. Full rescue of wild-type-like corticosterone and GR circadian rhythm and level in CRF1-/- mice by exogenous corticosterone does not affect CRF1 receptor-dependent cocaine reward but induces stereotypy responses to cocaine. These results indicate a critical role for the CRF1 receptor in cocaine reward, independently of the closely related HPA axis activity.",

We investigate crystalline nucleation in undercooled liquid Ni by means of x-ray absorption temperature scans in powder samples dispersed in Al2O3. We show that the crystallization process is initially dominated by a heterogeneous nucleation process that induces a purity/size selection effect. The nucleation rate displayed by the residual mass fraction of about 30% (determined down to 364 K below the melting point) is in agreement with empirical data from previous single droplet experiments extrapolated to the deeper undercooling range presently achieved. We investigate the possibility that this ultimate nucleation process is actually homogeneous by computing the rate in the framework of the classical nucleation theory. We adopted a recently implemented kinetic Monte Carlo simulation approach using extrapolated values for the self-diffusion coefficient and empirical or simulated models for the excess free energy. The comparison between measured and calculated rates indicates that the homogeneous nucleation scenario is likely.",

The surface of the Ti-Al alloy was prepared for HiPIMS according to different methods; the deposition of an intermediate Ti-Al interlayer was also investigated. A cyclic oxidation test (100 and 200 cycles) was performed up to 950 °C in burner rig apparatus adopting severe heating and cooling rates. The microstructure and composition of samples before and after oxidation were investigated by several techniques: microscopy (optical and SEM-EDS), X-ray photoelectron spectrometry (XPS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The oxide layers formed on the sample surface showed different thickness and composition depending on the presence of the protective coating and the processing path adopted for its deposition.

Yet drug-loading efficiency, sequestration by phagocytic cells, and tumor accumulation are sub-optimal. This would imply that radically new design approaches are needed to propel the clinical integration of nanomedicines, overcoming well-accepted clichés. This work briefly reviews the use of deformable discoidal nanoconstructs as a novel delivery strategy for therapeutic and imaging agents. Inspired by blood cell behavior, these nanoconstructs are designed to efficiently navigate the circulatory system, minimize sequestration by phagocytic cells, and recognize the tortuous angiogenic microvasculature of neoplastic masses. This article discusses the notion of nanoparticle margination and vascular adhesion, as well as advantages associated with deformable particles. Finally, details on the synthesis, physico-chemical properties, and in vivo characterization of discoidal polymeric nanoconstructs are provided, with particular emphasis on their ability to independently control size, shape, surface properties, and mechanical stiffness. These nanoconstructs could help in gaining a deeper understanding of the mechanisms regulating the behavior of nanomedicines and identifying optimal delivery strategies for patient-specific therapeutic interventions.",

In this paper, we design and assess a haptic guidance technique for 3D environments. First, we explore the modulation of vibration frequency to indicate the position of objects in the elevation plane. Then, we assessed a vibrotactile HMD made to render the position of objects in a 3D space around the subject by varying both stimulus loci and vibration frequency. Results have shown that frequencies modulated with a quadratic growth function allowed a more accurate, precise, and faster target localization in an active head pointing task.

This is possible by detecting the secondary particles produced by the interaction of the beam in the tissues. The position of the Bragg peak can be correlated to the charged particles emission point distribution measurement. The tracking device will be able to provide a fast response on the dose pattern by tracking the secondary charged fragments. The tracks are detected using 6 planes of scintillating fibers, providing the 3D coordinates of the track intersection with each plane. The fibers planes are followed by a plastic scintillator and by a small calorimeter built with a pixelated Lutetium Fine Silicate (LFS) crystal. A complete detector simulation, followed by the event reconstruction, has been performed to determine the achievable monitoring spatial resolution.",

Compared to HyQ, the new robot needs to be more rugged, more powerful and extend the existing locomotion skills with self-righting capability. Since the robot's actuation system has an impact on many aspects of the overall design/specifications of the robot (e.g., payload, speed, torque, overall mass, and compactness), this paper will pay special attention to the selection and sizing of the joint actuators. To obtain meaningful joint requirements for the new machine, we simulated seven characteristic motions that cover a wide range of required behaviors of an agile rough terrain robot, including trotting on rough terrain, stair climbing, push recovery, self-righting, etc. We will describe how to use the obtained joint requirements for the selection of the hydraulic actuator types, four-bar linkage parameters, and valve size. Poorly sized actuators may lead to limited robot capabilities or higher cost, weight, energy consumption, and cooling requirements. The main contributions of this paper are: 1) a novel design of an agile quadruped robot capable of performing trotting/crawling over flat/uneven terrain, balancing, and self-righting; 2) a detailed method to find suitable hydraulic cylinder/valve properties and linkage parameters with a specific focus on optimizing the actuator areas; and 3) to the best knowledge of the authors, the most complete review of hydraulic quadruped robots.",

We recently reported molecules designed according to the multitarget-directed ligand paradigm to exert combined activity at human fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) and dopamine receptor subtype D3 (D3R). Both targets are relevant for tackling several types of addiction (most notably nicotine addiction) and other compulsive behaviors. Here, we report an SAR exploration of a series of biphenyl-N-[4-[4-(2,3-substituted-phenyl)piperazine-1-yl]alkyl]carbamates, a novel class of molecules that had shown promising activities at the FAAH-D3R target combination in preliminary studies. We have rationalized the structural features conducive to activities at the main targets and investigated activities at two off-targets: dopamine receptor subtype D2 and endocannabinoid receptor CB1. To understand the unexpected affinity for the CB1 receptor, we devised a 3D-QSAR model, which we then prospectively validated. Compound 33 was selected for PK studies because it displayed balanced affinities for the main targets and clear selectivity over the two off-targets. 33 has good stability and oral bioavailability and can cross the blood-brain barrier.",

Detecting stiff nanoparticles buried in soft biological matrices by atomic force microscopy (AFM) based techniques represents a new frontier in the field of scanning probe microscopies, originally developed as surface characterization methods. Here we report the detection of stiff (magnetic) nanoparticles (NPs) internalized in cells by using contact resonance AFM (CR-AFM) employed as a potentially non-destructive subsurface characterization tool. Magnetite (Fe3O4) NPs were internalized in microglial cells from cerebral cortices of mouse embryos of 18 days by phagocytosis. Nanomechanical imaging of cells was performed by detecting the contact resonance frequencies (CRFs) of an AFM cantilever held in contact with the sample. Agglomerates of NPs internalized in cells were visualized on the basis of the local increase in the contact stiffness with respect to the surrounding biological matrix. A second AFM-based technique for nanomechanical imaging, i.e., HarmoniX™, as well as magnetic force microscopy and light microscopy were used to confirm the CR-AFM results. Thus, CR-AFM was demonstrated as a promising technique for subsurface imaging of nanomaterials in biological samples.",

To do it, we feed all their energy terms with different sets of orbitals obtained previously from self-consistent density functional theory calculations using several exchange-correlation functionals (e.g., PBE, PBE0, PBEH&amp;H), or directly with HF-PBE orbitals, to see their effect on selected datasets for atomization and reaction energies, the latter proned to marked self-interaction errors. We find that the PBE-QIDH double-hybrid model shows a great consistency, as the best results are always obtained for the set of orbitals corresponding to its hybrid scheme, which prompts us to recommend this model without any other fitting or reparameterization. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Here we report a series of Sirt2 inhibitors based on the 1,2,4-oxadiazole scaffold.

Their mechanism of inhibition is uncompetitive toward both the peptide substrate and NAD+, and the crystal structure of a 1,2,4-oxadiazole analog in complex with Sirt2 and ADP-ribose reveals its orientation in a still unexplored subcavity useful for further inhibitor development. Tested in leukemia cell lines, 35 and 39 induced apoptosis and/or showed anti proliferative effects at 10 or 25 μM after 48 h. Western blot analyses confirmed the involvement of Sirt2 inhibition for their effects in NB4 and in U937 cells.

FT-IR analyses in real time and photorheology tests allowed finding the best composition and printing parameters. Printing conditions were adjusted to get 3D structures from formulations with a content up to 0.3 wt % of CNTs. The presence of the filler causes a decrease of the crosslinking density, which could be overcome using higher intensity light sources. Electrical conductivity measurements performed on the printed samples give promising results for the use of the developed formulation for the building of 3D structures with electrical properties.",

KGaA, Weinheim Many researchers have shown that selected anodic processes allow effective treatment of a very large amount of wastewater contaminated by pollutants resistant to biological processes. In the meantime, various authors have also shown that carbon dioxide can be converted into higher value products, such as formic acid or synthesis gas, by cathodic reduction at suitable cathodes. These two processes present interesting economic potential that, however, still needs to be improved for further development at an industrial level. Herein, these two kinds of process are combined in the same cell to improve their economic feasibility. In particular, the anodic treatment of wastewater at a boron-doped diamond anode and the cathodic reduction of carbon dioxide to formic acid at a tin cathode are performed simultaneously in a divided cell. Aqueous solutions of Acid Orange 7, which is a widely used azoic dye resistant to conventional biological processes, are used as a model for wastewater. The effect of various operating parameters (including current density, mixing rate, and pH) on both processes is studied. It is possible, under optimized operating conditions, to successfully achieve in a single reactor both the treatment of wastewater contaminated by resistant pollutants and the conversion of carbon dioxide into formic acid. This paired electrolysis process can improve substantially economic figures with respect to each separate process.",

Diagnostics and prognostics of natural gas steam reforming (NGSR) reactors are of utmost importance for solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) systems, where a fuel processor fault can cause damage to the SOFC stack. Most common faults are due to carbon deposition. We investigate this phenomenon through a model based on microscopic mass, energy and momentum balances of a tubular NGSR reactor. The model includes a detailed local reaction kinetics specific for Ni-based catalysts, and is integrated numerically using a finite element method (FEM) implemented through COMSOL Multiphysics 5.2. Results obtained from the simulation of a laboratory scale reactor are validated on the basis of literature data. Furthermore, the model is applied to an NGSR fuel processor designed for an 1.1 kW SOFC system. The model allows to identify the area where carbon deposition is expected to occur, which is a key feature in view of developing specific diagnostic and prognostic tools. The simulation results demonstrate that safety criteria based on the feedstock steam to carbon (S/C) ratio can be misleading in a number of operating conditions.",

In animal models the administration of a high-fat diet caused a reduction in sperm quality, by impairing gamete energy metabolism. The aim of this study was to investigate a possible effect of dietary fatty acids supplementation in the modulation of sperm energy metabolism and, in turn, in the improvement of sperm quality in rats fed a high-fat diet. Sexually mature male Sprague–Dawley rats were divided into four groups and fed for 4 weeks a standard diet (control group), a high-fat diet (enriched in 35% of fat and 15% sucrose), a high-fat diet supplemented with 2.5% olive oil (a source of monounsaturated fatty acids) or a high-fat diet supplemented with 2.5% krill oil (a source of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids). Liver and adipose tissue weight, plasma glucose, insulin and lipid concentrations were determined. Activities of enzymes involved in sperm energetic metabolism were evaluated by spectrophotometric assays. Sperm mitochondrial respiratory efficiency was also assayed. The obtained results suggest that olive oil partially counteracts the negative effects of a high-fat diet on sperm quality, by increasing gamete motility, by reducing oxidative stress and slightly improving mitochondrial respiration efficiency. On the other hand, krill oil determines an increase in sperm concentration and motility, an increase in the activities of lactate dehydrogenase, Krebs cycle enzymes and respiratory chain complexes; a parallel increase in the cellular levels of ATP and a reduction in oxidative damage were also observed. These results suggest that dietary fatty acids are able to positively influence sperm quality and function.",

Different measures of brain connectivity can be defined based on neuroimaging read-outs, including structural and functional connectivity. Neurological and psychiatric conditions are often associated with abnormal connectivity, but comparing the effects of the disease on different types of connectivity remains a challenge. In this paper, we address the problem of quantifying the relative effects of brain disease on structural and functional connectivity at a group level. Within the framework of a graph representation of connectivity, we introduce a kernel two-sample test as an effective method to assess the difference between the patients and control group. Moreover, we propose a common representation space for structural and functional connectivity networks, and a novel test statistics to quantitatively assess differential effects of the disease on different types of connectivity. We apply this approach to a dataset from BTBR mice, a murine model of Agenesis of the Corpus Callosum (ACC), a congenital disorder characterized by the absence of the main bundle of fibers connecting the two hemispheres. We used normo-callosal mice (B6) as a comparator. The application of the proposed methods to this data-set shows that the two types of connectivity can be successfully used to discriminate between BTBR and B6, meaning that both types of connectivity are affected by ACC. However, our novel test statistics shows that structural connectivity is significantly more affected than functional connectivity, consistent with the idea that functional connectivity has a robust topology that can tolerate substantial alterations in its structural connectivity substrate.",

The present study was aimed at characterizing the effects of Withania somnifera (Wse) and Mucuna pruriens (Mpe) on a Drosophila melanogaster model for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). In particular, the effects of Wse and Mpe were assessed following feeding the flies selectively overexpressing the wild human copper, zinc-superoxide dismutase (hSOD1-gain-of-function) in Drosophila motoneurons. Although ALS-hSOD1 mutants showed no impairment in life span, with respect to GAL4 controls, the results revealed impairment of climbing behaviour, muscle electrophysiological parameters (latency and amplitude of ePSPs) as well as thoracic ganglia mitochondrial functions. Interestingly, Wse treatment significantly increased lifespan of hSDO1 while Mpe had not effect. Conversely, both Wse and Mpe significantly rescued climbing impairment, and also latency and amplitude of ePSPs as well as failure responses to high frequency DLM stimulation. Finally, mitochondrial alterations were any more present in Wse-but not in Mpe-Treated hSOD1 mutants. Hence, given the role of inflammation in the development of ALS, the high translational impact of the model, the known anti-inflammatory properties of these extracts, and the viability of their clinical use, these results suggest that the application of Wse and Mpe might represent a valuable pharmacological strategy to counteract the progression of ALS and related symptoms.",

Measurements were performed using a time-domain diffuse optical technique. The spectrum was extracted by carefully accounting for various spectral distortion effects, due to sample and system properties. The contribution of several tissue constituents (water, lipid, collagen, oxy, and deoxy-hemoglobin) to the absorption properties of a collagen-rich in vivo bone location, such as radius distal in the 500-to 1700-nm wavelength region, is also discussed, suggesting bone diagnostics as a potential area of interest.",

Localized states trap waves propagating in a disordered potential and play a crucial role in Anderson localization, which is the absence of diffusion due to disorder.

This is the same degree of isolation found in the homogeneous core of a single-mode optical fibre. Here we show that localized states of a disordered optical fibre are single mode: the transmission channels possess a high degree of resilience to perturbation and invariance with respect to the launch conditions. Our experimental approach allows identification and characterization of the single-mode transmission channels in a disordered matrix, demonstrating low losses and densely packed single modes. These disordered and wavelength-sensitive channels may be exploited to de-multiplex different colours at different locations.",

Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the death of dopaminergic neurons and by accumulation of alpha-synuclein (aS) aggregates in the surviving neurons. The dopamine catabolite 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetaldehyde (DOPAL) is a highly reactive and toxic molecule that leads to aS oligomerization by covalent modifications to lysine residues. Here we show that DOPAL-induced aS oligomer formation in neurons is associated with damage of synaptic vesicles, and with alterations in the synaptic vesicles pools. To investigate the molecular mechanism that leads to synaptic impairment, we first aimed to characterize the biochemical and biophysical properties of the aS-DOPAL oligomers; heterogeneous ensembles of macromolecules able to permeabilise cholesterol-containing lipid membranes. aS-DOPAL oligomers can induce dopamine leak in an in vitro model of synaptic vesicles and in cellular models. The dopamine released, after conversion to DOPAL in the cytoplasm, could trigger a noxious cycle that further fuels the formation of aS-DOPAL oligomers, inducing neurodegeneration.",

            "abstract": "© 2017 Elsevier Ltd ADHD, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are psychiatric diseases with a strong genetic component which share dopaminergic alterations. Dopamine transporter (DAT) genetics might be potentially implicated in all these disorders. However, in contrast to DAT absence, the effects of DAT hypofunction especially in developmental trajectories have been scarcely addressed. Thus, we comprehensively studied DAT hypofunctional mice (DAT+/-) from adolescence to adulthood to disentangle DAT-dependent alterations in the development of psychiatric-relevant phenotypes. From pre-adolescence onward, DAT+/- displayed a hyperactive phenotype, while responses to external stimuli and sensorimotor gating abilities were unaltered. General cognitive impairments in adolescent DAT+/- were partially ameliorated during adulthood in males but not in females. Despite this, attentional and impulsivity deficits were evident in DAT+/- adult males. At the molecular level, DAT+/- mice showed a reduced expression of Homer1a in the prefrontal cortex, while other brain regions as well as Arc and Homer1b expression were mostly unaffected. Amphetamine treatments reverted DAT+/- hyperactivity and rescued cognitive deficits. Moreover, amphetamine shifted DAT-dependent Homer1a altered expression from prefrontal cortex to striatal regions. These behavioral and molecular phenotypes indicate that a genetic-driven DAT hypofunction alters neurodevelopmental trajectories consistent with ADHD, but not with schizophrenia and bipolar disorders.",

We demonstrate that all Italian scholars of SSH and LHS are equals, as far as their publishing habits. They share the same general law, which is a lognormal. At the same time, however, they are different, because we measured their scientific production with different indicators required by the Italian law; we eliminated the “silent” scholars and obtained different scaling values—proxy of their productivity rates.

We previously identified the founding member of the Eukaryotic EndoU ribonuclease family, whose components display unique biochemical features and are flexibly involved in important biological processes, such as ribosome biogenesis, tumorigenesis and viral replication. Here we report the discovery of the CG3303 gene product, which we named DendoU, as a novel family member in Drosophila. Functional characterisation revealed that DendoU is essential for Drosophila viability and nervous system activity. Pan-neuronal silencing of dendoU resulted in fly immature phenotypes, highly reduced lifespan and dramatic motor performance defects. Neuron-subtype selective silencing showed that DendoU is particularly important in cholinergic circuits. At the molecular level, we unveiled that DendoU is a positive regulator of the neurodegeneration-associated protein dTDP-43, whose downregulation recapitulates the ensemble of dendoU-dependent phenotypes. This interdisciplinary work, which comprehends in silico, in vitro and in vivo studies, unveils a relevant role for DendoU in Drosophila nervous system physio-pathology and highlights that DendoU-mediated neurotoxicity is, at least in part, contributed by dTDP-43 loss-of-function.",

For this reason, drug delivery to the brain is much more difficult than that to other compartments of the body. In order to bypass or cross the BBB, many strategies have been developed: invasive techniques, such as temporary disruption of the BBB or direct intraventricular and intracerebral administration of the drug, as well as noninvasive techniques. Preliminary results, reported in the large number of studies on the potential strategies for brain delivery, are encouraging, but it is far too early to draw any conclusion about the actual use of these therapeutic approaches. Among the most recent, but still pioneering, approaches related to the nasal mucosa properties, the permeabilization of the BBB via nasal mucosal engrafting can offer new potential opportunities. It should be emphasized that this surgical procedure is quite invasive, but the implication for patient outcome needs to be compared to the gold standard of direct intracranial injection, and evaluated whilst keeping in mind that central nervous system diseases and lysosomal storage diseases are chronic and severely debilitating and that up to now no therapy seems to be completely successful.",

            "abstract": "© 2017 American Chemical Society. The reliable exploitation of localized surface plasmon resonance in transparent conductive oxides is being pursued to push the developement of an emerging class of advanced dynamic windows, which offer the opportunity to selectively and dynamically control the intensity of the incoming thermal radiation without affecting visible transparency. In this view, Nb-doped TiO2 colloidal nanocrystals are particularly promising, as they have a wide band gap and their plasmonic features can be finely tailored across the near-infrared region by varying the concentration of dopants. Four batches of Nb-doped TiO2 nanocrystals with different doping levels (from 0% to 15% of niobium content) have been used here to prepare highly transparent mesoporous electrodes for near-infrared selective electrochromic devices, capable of dynamically modulating the intensity of the transmitted radiation upon the application of a relatively small bias voltage. An engineered dual band electrochromic device (made of 10%-Nb-doped TiO2 nanocrystals) has been eventually fabricated. It was shown to provide two complementary spectroelectrochemical responses, which can be independently controlled through the intensity of the applied potential: a large variation of the optical transmittance in the near-infrared region (by the intensification of the localized surface plasmon scattering) was achievable in the 0-3 V voltage window, reaching values greater than 64% in the spectral range from 800 to 2000 nm, whereas the visible absorption could also be intensively varied at higher potentials (from 3 to 4 V), driven by Li intercalation into the TiO2 anatase lattice.",

            "abstract": "© AlphaMed Press and 2016 The Authors STEM CELLS published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of AlphaMed Press. The transcription factor MEF2C (Myocyte Enhancer Factor 2C) plays an established role in the early steps of myogenic differentiation. However, the involvement of MEF2C in adult myogenesis and in muscle regeneration has not yet been systematically investigated. Alternative splicing of mammalian MEF2C transcripts gives rise to two mutually exclusive protein variants: MEF2Cα2 which exerts a positive control of myogenic differentiation, and MEF2Cα1, in which the α1 domain acts as trans-repressor of the MEF2C pro-differentiation activity itself. However, MEF2Cα1 variants are persistently expressed in differentiating cultured myocytes, suggesting a role in adult myogenesis. We found that overexpression of both MEF2Cα1/α2 proteins in a mouse model of muscle injury promotes muscle regeneration and hypertrophy, with each isoform promoting different stages of myogenesis. Besides the ability of MEF2Cα2 to increase differentiation, we found that overexpressed MEF2Cα1 enhances both proliferation and differentiation of primary myoblasts, and activates the AKT/mTOR/S6K anabolic signaling pathway in newly formed myofibers. The multiple activities of MEF2Cα1 are modulated by phosphorylation of Ser98 and Ser110, two amino acid residues located in the α1 domain of MEF2Cα1. These specific phosphorylations allow the interaction of MEF2Cα1 with the peptidylprolyl isomerase PIN1, a regulator of MEF2C functions. Overall, in this study we established a novel regulatory mechanism in which the expression and the phosphorylation of MEF2Cα1 are critically required to sustain the adult myogenesis. The described molecular mechanism will represent a new potential target for the development of therapeutical strategies to treat muscle- wasting diseases.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 Elsevier Ltd Environmental enrichment (EE) has a remarkable impact on brain development. Continuous exposure to EE from birth determines a significant acceleration of visual system maturation both at retinal and cortical levels. A pre-weaning enriched experience is sufficient to trigger the accelerated maturation of the visual system, suggesting that factors affected by EE during the first days of life might prime visual circuits towards a faster development. The search for such factors is crucial not only to gain a better understanding of the molecular hierarchy of brain development but also to identify molecular pathways amenable to be targeted to correct atypical brain developmental trajectories. Here, we showed that IGF-1 levels are increased in the visual cortex of EE rats as early as P6 and this is a crucial event for setting in motion the developmental program induced by EE. Early intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) infusion of IGF-1 in standard rats was sufficient to mimic the action of EE on visual acuity development, whereas blocking IGF-1 signaling by i.c.v. injections of the IGF-1 receptor antagonist JB1 prevented the deployment of EE effects. Early IGF-1 decreased the ratio between the expression of NKCC1 and KCC2 cation/chloride transporters, and the reversal potential for GABAAR-driven Cl− currents (ECl) was shifted toward more negative potentials, indicating that IGF-1 is a crucial factor in accelerating the maturation of GABAergic neurotransmission and promoting the developmental switch of GABA polarity from excitation to inhibition. In addition, early IGF-1 promoted a later occurring increase in its own expression, suggesting a priming effect of early IGF-1 in driving post-weaning cortical maturation.",

However, such gaps rarely lead to the highly insulating state expected at low temperatures. This long-standing puzzle is usually explained by charge inhomogeneity. Here we revisit the issue by investigating proximity-induced superconductivity in gapped graphene and comparing normal-state measurements in the Hall bar and Corbino geometries. We find that the supercurrent at the charge neutrality point in gapped graphene propagates along narrow channels near the edges. This observation is corroborated by using the edgeless Corbino geometry in which case resistivity at the neutrality point increases exponentially with increasing the gap, as expected for an ordinary semiconductor. In contrast, resistivity in the Hall bar geometry saturates to values of about a few resistance quanta. We attribute the metallic-like edge conductance to a nontrivial topology of gapped Dirac spectra.",

The sample morphology and composition were identified using scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray spectroscopy. The latter technique reveals an inverse spinel structure with Jahn-Teller tetragonal distortion. The static magnetization was measured using vibrating sample magnetometer. Magnetic force microscopy was used in combination with the magnetization data to demonstrate the finite size effect of the magnetic spins and their casting behavior due to the introduction of copper ions in the tetrahedral magnetic sub-lattices, which results in tetragonal distorting the spinel structure of the copper ferrite. The magnetic properties of materials are a result of the collective behavior of the magnetic spins, and magnetic force microscopy can probe the collective behavior of the magnetic spins in copper ferrite, yet providing a sufficient resolution to map the effects below the micrometer size scale, such as the magnetic spin canting. A theoretical study was done to clarify the finite size effect of Jahn-Teller distortion on the magnetic properties of the material. When the particles are in the nano-scale, below the single domain size, their magnetic properties are very sensitive to their size change.",

In the present work, the effect of different processing parameters during the preparation of poly (butylene terephthalate) nanocomposites, through ring-opening polymerization of cyclic butylene terephthalate in presence of graphite nanoplatelets (GNP), was thoroughly addressed. Processing temperature (240 °C or 260 °C), extrusion time (5 or 10 min) and shear rate (50 or 100 rpm) were varied by means of a full factorial design of experiment approach, leading to the preparation of polybutylene terephthalate/GNP nanocomposite in 8 different processing conditions. Morphology and quality of GNP were investigated by means of electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, thermogravimetry and Raman spectroscopy. Molecular weight of the polymer matrix in nanocomposites and nanoflake dispersion were experimentally determined as a function of the different processing conditions. The effect of transformation parameters on electrical and thermal properties was studied by means of electrical and thermal conductivity measurement. Heat and charge transport performance evidenced a clear correlation with the dispersion and fragmentation of the GNP nanoflakes; in particular, gentle processing conditions (low shear rate, short mixing time) turned out to be the most favourable condition to obtain high conductivity values.",

We develop a computational framework to examine the factors responsible for scattering-induced distortions of coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) signals in turbid samples. We apply the Huygens-Fresnel wave-based electric field superposition (HF-WEFS) method combined with the radiating dipole approximation to compute the effects of scattering-induced distortions of focal excitation fields on the far-field CARS signal. We analyze the effect of spherical scatterers, placed in the vicinity of the focal volume, on the CARS signal emitted by different objects (2μm diameter solid sphere, 2μm diameter myelin cylinder and 2μm diameter myelin tube). We find that distortions in the CARS signals arise not only from attenuation of the focal field but also from scattering-induced changes in the spatial phase that modifies the angular distribution of the CARS emission. Our simulations further show that CARS signal attenuation can be minimized by using a high numerical aperture condenser. Moreover, unlike the CARS intensity image, CARS images formed by taking the ratio of CARS signals obtained using x- and y-polarized input fields is relatively insensitive to the effects of spherical scatterers. Our computational framework provide a mechanistic approach to characterizing scattering-induced distortions in coherent imaging of turbid media and may inspire bottom-up approaches for adaptive optical methods for image correction.",

In detail, a fine tuning of the photophysical properties can be reached simply selecting the position of the donor unit on the DBF molecule.

Tests were conducted in triplicate using different feeding pH values (pHfeed) ranging from 3 to 13. The MFCs inoculated with marine consortia had a strong self-regulation ability and actively counterbalanced small variations in pHfeedmaintaining the pH inside the anodic chamber (pHanode) close to neutrality. As soon as the pHanodedeviated from neutrality it affected MFCs' performances. Alkaline conditions with pHanodevalues between 8 and 10 corresponded to the formation of a denser biofilm together with the best performance in terms of maximum power density (Pmax). Conversely, when the pHanodereached values lower than 5.5 or higher than 10, a sharp drop in MFC performances, as well as a decrease of viable population, were observed. Interestingly, the system was able to survive these extreme conditions and restart working effectively when neutrality was reset. The obtained results underline the high adaptability and recovery ability of anodic marine consortia even in extreme conditions, suggesting the employment of this inoculum for MFC applications as biosensors for on-site seawater monitoring or as power supply units to be installed in remote area.",

This study shows that electrical conductivity and elastic modulus of conductive thermoplastic elastomers containing graphene nanoplatelets (GnPs) can be significantly enhanced by exposing them to stretch-release cycles, without exceeding 20% of the maximum strain.

Up to 60% of reduction in electrical resistance and 30% enhancement in elastic modulus were measured for certain nanocomposites at the end of 1000 cycles.

            "abstract": "© 2017 Elsevier Ltd Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) are bioelectrochemical devices that directly convert the chemical energy stored in complex organic compounds into electricity. In order to improve their performance, a complete understanding of the reactions that occur inside bioanodes is essential. Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) represents a powerful method for the investigation of these biophysicochemical processes. However, the larger part of EIS studies on MFCs proposed in the literature are often misconducted, employing cell configurations or measurement conditions which do not always allow obtaining reliable conclusions. In this work, EIS measurements, in three electrode configuration, were recorded as a function of different external resistances, to characterize and compare the impedance response of two different mixed-community microbial bioanodes coming from the same freshwater sediment sample but enriched with two different media, namely a general one and a ferric citrate one. In order to construct an appropriate equivalent electrical model and to give a right physical interpretation of the obtained results, focused control experiments in abiotic and starving conditions were performed. Three processes were found to govern the bioanode impedance: a substrate/products diffusion process, a biofilm process and an electrode/electrolyte interfacial process. General-enriched bioanodes showed a more efficient electron transfer mechanism, with faster biofilm and diffusion time constants, lower resistance values and higher charge storage capacities. The maximum power point of general-enriched biofilms (79 mW/m2) occurred at an anode potential of −0.4 V; on the contrary ferric citrate enrichment resulted in a maximum power density of 38 mW/m2. These results were in accordance with cyclic voltammetry analysis, that demonstrated a charge transfer mechanism centered at −0.4 V for general enrichment and −0.22 V for ferric citrate one.",

Nanopores are emerging as powerful tools for biosensing at a single molecule level, and their characterization under different working conditions is crucial for applications. In this perspective, we studied the ionic and electroosmotic flows across an α-hemolysin nanopore using an extensive set of molecular dynamics simulations. Results show that the alteration in the solution pH has a dramatic effect on both electroosmotic flow and nanopore selectivity. Upon lowering the pH, the internal pore surface becomes globally more positively charged and, consequently, the transport of positive ions is hindered leading to a strong unbalance of positive and negative ionic fluxes. This unbalance gives rise to an intense electroosmotic flow that in certain regimes can overwhelm the ionic flux. Finally, we compared our data with continuum prediction for ideal electroosmotic flows, showing that, although the α-hemolysin case is quite far from the ideality, the continuum theory is able to capture the magnitude of the electroosmotic mechanism.",

CA polymer at 15% w/v was dissolved in acetone and then 1% or 5% v/v of EOs was added to the polymer solution. The utilized essential oils were rosemary and oregano oils. Then, the CA/EOs in acetone solution were electrospun, creating micro/nanofibers, approximately 700–1500 nm in diameter. Raman spectroscopy was used to detect the attachment of the EOs in the CA electrospun fibers (ESFs). Scanning electron microscopy was used to study the morphology, topography and dimensions of the ESFs. The formed CA/EOs ESFs are found to have good antimicrobial properties against three common microbial species, frequently found in difficult to treat infections: Bacteria species Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and the yeast Candida albicans. ESFs with 5% v/v oregano oil with respect to the initial solution, showed the best antimicrobial and anti-biofilm effects due to the potency of this EO against bacteria and fungi, especially for Escherichia coli and Candida albicans. This work describes an effective and simple method to prepare CA/EOs ESFs and opens up many new applications of micro/nanofibers such as improved antimicrobial wound dressings, anti-biofilm surfaces, sensors and packaging alternatives.",

The inclusion of iodide additives in hybrid perovskite precursor solutions has been successfully exploited to improve the solar cell efficiency but their impact on perovskite formation, morphology and photovoltaic performance is still not clear. Here an extensive analysis of the effect of iodide additives in the solution-phase and during the perovskite film formation, as well as their effect on device performance is provided. The results demonstrate that in the solution-phase the additives promote the formation of lead poly-iodide species resulting in the disaggregation of the inorganic lead iodide framework and in the formation of smaller nuclei inducing the growth of uniform and smooth perovskite films. Most importantly, the complexation capability of different iodide additives does not only directly affect film morphology but also influences the density of defect states by varying the stoichiometry of precursors. These findings demonstrate that the fine control of the interactions of the chemical species in the solution-phase is essential for the precise control of the morphology at the nanoscale and the growth of the perovskite films with a reduced density of defect states. Therefore, the in-depth understanding of all the processes involved in the solution-phase is the first step for the development of a facile and reproducible approach for the fabrication of hybrid perovskite solar cells with enhanced photovoltaic performance.",

Yet, evidence that rodent visual cortex is capable of advanced visual processing, such as object recognition, is limited. Here we investigate how neurons located along the progression of extrastriate areas that, in the rat brain, run laterally to primary visual cortex, encode object information. We found a progressive functional specialization of neural responses along these areas, with: (1) a sharp reduction of the amount of low-level, energy-related visual information encoded by neuronal firing; and (2) a substantial increase in the ability of both single neurons and neuronal populations to support discrimination of visual objects under identity-preserving transformations (e.g., position and size changes). These findings strongly argue for the existence of a rat object-processing pathway, and point to the rodents as promising models to dissect the neuronal circuitry underlying transformation-tolerant recognition of visual objects.",

Energy sustainability analysis and durability of Microbial Fuel Cells (MFCs) as energy source are necessary in order to move from the laboratory scale to full-scale application. This paper focus on these two aspects by considering the energy performances of an original experimental test with MFC conducted for six months under an external load of 1000 Ω. Energy sustainability is quantified using Energy Payback Time, the time necessary to produce the energy already spent to construct the MFC device. The results of experiment reveal that the energy sustainability of this specific MFC is never reached due to energy expenditure (i.e. for pumping) and to the low amount of energy produced. Hence, different MFC materials and architectures were analysed to find guidelines for future MFC development. Among these, only sedimentary fuel cells (Benthic MFCs) seem sustainable from an energetic point of view, with a minimum duration of 2.7 years. An energy balance approach highlights the importance of energy calculation. However, this is very often not taken into account in literature. This study outlines promising methodology for the design of an alternative layout of energy sustainable MFC and wastewater management systems.",

Electron-phonon coupling directly determines the stability of cooperative order in solids, including superconductivity, charge, and spin density waves. Therefore, the ability to enhance or reduce electron-phonon coupling by optical driving may open up new possibilities to steer materials' functionalities, potentially at high speeds. Here, we explore the response of bilayer graphene to dynamical modulation of the lattice, achieved by driving optically active in-plane bond stretching vibrations with femtosecond midinfrared pulses. The driven state is studied by two different ultrafast spectroscopic techniques. First, terahertz time-domain spectroscopy reveals that the Drude scattering rate decreases upon driving. Second, the relaxation rate of hot quasiparticles, as measured by time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, increases. These two independent observations are quantitatively consistent with one another and can be explained by a transient threefold enhancement of the electron-phonon coupling constant. The findings reported here provide useful perspective for related experiments, which reported the enhancement of superconductivity in alkali-doped fullerites when a similar phonon mode was driven.",

In this regard, desirable 3D composites should offer tunable structural and functional properties to support appropriate cellular growth and biomechanical loads. In this work, we realized 3D alginate hydrogels functionalized with graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets for the creation of cell laden hybrid materials with proper mechanical properties for tissue engineering applications. We monitored the mechanical proprieties of 2 wt% GO/Alg hydrogels up to one month demonstrating a significant improvement of the compressive elastic modulus reaching values of 300 KPa (6 times higher stiffness), which are close to those of articular tissues. This finding has been correlated to increased intermolecular hydrogen bonds over time between GO and Alg, observed through FT-IR analysis. Interestingly, we show that 3D GO/Alg hydrogels trigger cellular activity in vitro, as demonstrated by the statistically significant improvement of the viability of fibroblasts encapsulated in GO/Alg hydrogels and by the absence of cytotoxicity of suspended GO flakes. All these findings indicate that GO/Alg hydrogel is a promising material for articular tissue engineering, where biomechanical requirements are crucial.",

By this approach, the synergistic interaction between commercial NIR-fluorophores and ultrasmall metal nanoparticles is exploited to produce a PA signal enhancement in the biological window.

The organic electrochemical transistor (OECT), which is low cost and completely integrated e-textile, is decorated by adsorption of the fungal laccase POXA1b, and is used as biosensor for the direct detection of Tyrosine (L-Tyr) without the use of electron mediators. The detection of Tyr in real-case scenario such as human physiological fluids would own a paramount importance in noninvasive analysis of the patient's condition, monitoring and preventing several pathologies. To assess the reaction progression, the redox process is studied by UV–visible absorption with test reference molecule of 2,2′-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonate) (ABTS): the results confirmed that the oxidation reaction is driven by the presence of laccase enzyme and direct electron transfer occurred. The modulation of the signal response and the kinetic of the signal is used to detect Tyr molecule in aqueous solution and the role of the enzyme adsorption on the textile is analyzed. A kinetic analysis of the characteristic modulation times of the sensing curves, confirm the sensing properties of the textile device. The textile-based biosensor is demonstrated to monitor human health biomarkers through wearable applications in a non-invasive way, finding potential application in sport, healthcare and working safety.",

            "abstract": "© 2017 The Author(s).Background: Monocytes/macrophages are activated in several autoimmune diseases, including systemic sclerosis (scleroderma; SSc), with increased expression of interferon (IFN)-regulatory genes and inflammatory cytokines, suggesting dysregulation of the innate immune response in autoimmunity. In this study, we investigated whether the lytic form of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection (infectious EBV) is present in scleroderma monocytes and contributes to their activation in SSc. Methods: Monocytes were isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) depleted of the CD19+ cell fraction, using CD14/CD16 negative-depletion. Circulating monocytes from SSc and healthy donors (HDs) were infected with EBV. Gene expression of innate immune mediators were evaluated in EBV-infected monocytes from SSc and HDs. Involvement of Toll-like receptor (TLR)8 in viral-mediated TLR8 response was investigated by comparing the TLR8 expression induced by infectious EBV to the expression stimulated by CL075/TLR8/agonist-ligand in the presence of TLR8 inhibitor in THP-1 cells. Results: Infectious EBV strongly induced TLR8 expression in infected SSc and HD monocytes in vitro. Markers of activated monocytes, such as IFN-regulated genes and chemokines, were upregulated in SSc- and HD-EBV-infected monocytes. Inhibiting TLR8 expression reduced virally induced TLR8 in THP-1 infected cells, demonstrating that innate immune activation by infectious EBV is partially dependent on TLR8. Viral mRNA and proteins were detected in freshly isolated SSc monocytes. Microarray analysis substantiated the evidence of an increased IFN signature and altered level of TLR8 expression in SSc monocytes carrying infectious EBV compared to HD monocytes. Conclusion: This study provides the first evidence of infectious EBV in monocytes from patients with SSc and links EBV to the activation of TLR8 and IFN innate immune response in freshly isolated SSc monocytes. This study provides the first evidence of EBV replication activating the TLR8 molecular pathway in primary monocytes. Immunogenicity of infectious EBV suggests a novel mechanism mediating monocyte inflammation in SSc, by which EBV triggers the innate immune response in infected cells.",

When two partners perform a joint physical task, each of them experiences a force that sums together a component generated by the partner and another generated from the environment. To investigate whether subjects are able to distinguish these two components, we created a force perception task in which two partners indicate the direction of an external force applied to a rigid bar that they grasp from opposite ends. In a previous study we showed that dyads adopt different response strategies and that many do not split the external force in a manner that allows both subjects to experience a meaningful interaction force. Here, we investigated whether a visual feedback on the partner's and correct response let dyads learn how to best split the external force. We show that this is not the case and that the dyads' force sharing and response strategies were comparable to those of the previous experiment.",

            "abstract": "© 2017 IEEE. Vibrotactile feedback is broadly used to support different tasks in virtual and augmented reality applications, such as navigation, communication, attentional redirection, or to enhance the sense of presence in virtual environments. Thus, we aim to include the haptic component to the most popular wearable used in VR applications: the VR headset. After studying the acuity around the head for vibrating stimuli, and trying different parameters, actuators, and configurations, we developed a haptic guidance technique to be used in a vibrotactile Head-mounted Display (HMD). Our vi-brotactile HMD was made to render the position of objects in a 3D space around the subject by varying both stimulus loci and vibration frequency. In this demonstration, the participants will interact with different scenarios where the mission is to select a number of predefined objects. However, instead of displaying occlusive graphical information to point to these objects, vibrotactile cues will provide guidance in the VR setup. Participants will see that our haptic guidance technique can be both easy to use and entertaining. (See Video: https://youtu.be/-H0MQy6QD7M).",

However, due to safety issues, commercially-available medical robots do not currently provide the clinician with haptic feedback. Methods: This work presents the experimental evaluation of a teleoperation system for robot-assisted medical procedures able to provide magnified haptic feedback to the clinician. Forces registered at the operating table are magnified and provided to the clinician through a 7-DoF haptic interface. The same interface is also used to control the motion of a 6-DoF slave robotic manipulator. The safety of the system is guaranteed by a time-domain passivity-based control algorithm. Results: Two experiments were carried out on stiffness discrimination (during palpation and needle insertion) and one experiment on needle guidance. Conclusions: Our haptic-enabled teleoperation system improved the performance with respect to direct hand interaction of 80%, 306%, and 27% in stiffness discrimination through palpation, stiffness discrimination during needle insertion, and guidance, respectively.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 Elsevier B.V. The c.2101 A &gt; G synonymous change (p.G674G) in the gene for ATR, a key player in the DNA-damage response, has been the first identified genetic cause of Seckel Syndrome (SS), an orphan disease characterized by growth and mental retardation. This mutation mainly causes exon 9 skipping, through an ill-defined mechanism. Through ATR minigene expression studies, we demonstrated that the detrimental effect of this mutation (6 ± 1% of correct transcripts only) depends on the poor exon 9 definition (47 ± 4% in the ATRwt context), because the change was ineffective when the weak 5′ or the 3′ splice sites (ss) were strengthened (scores from 0.54 to 1) by mutagenesis. Interestingly, the exonic c.2101 A nucleotide is conserved across species, and the SS-causing mutation is predicted to concurrently strengthen a Splicing Silencer (ESS) and weaken a Splicing Enhancer (ESE). Consistently, the artificial c.2101 A &gt; C change, predicted to weaken the ESE only, moderately impaired exon inclusion (28 ± 7% of correct transcripts). The observation that an antisense oligonucleotide (AONATR) targeting the c.2101 A position recovers exon inclusion in the mutated context supports a major role of the underlying ESS. A U1snRNA variant (U1ATR) designed to perfectly base-pair the weak 5'ss, rescued exon inclusion (63 ± 3%) in the ATRSS-allele. Most importantly, upon lentivirus-mediated delivery, the U1ATR partially rescued ATR mRNA splicing (from ~ 19% to ~ 54%) and protein (from negligible to ~ 6%) in embryonic fibroblasts derived from humanized ATRSS mice. Altogether these data elucidate the molecular mechanisms of the ATR c.2101 A &gt; G mutation and identify two potential complementary RNA-based therapies for Seckel syndrome.",

Smart drug delivery systems represent an interesting tool to significantly improve the efficiency and the precision in the treatment of a broad category of diseases. In this context, a drug delivery mediated by nanosecond pulsed electric fields seems a promising technique, allowing for a controlled release and uptake of drugs by the synergy between the electropulsation and nanocarriers with encapsulated drugs. The main concern about the use of electroporation for drug delivery applications is the difference in dimension between the liposome (nanometer range) and the cell (micrometer range). The choice of liposome dimension is not trivial. Liposomes larger than 500 nm of diameter could be recognized as pathogen agents by the immune system, while liposomes of smaller size would require external electric field of high amplitudes for the membrane electroporation that could compromise the cell viability. The aim of this work is to theoretically study the possibility of a simultaneous cell and liposomes electroporation. The numerical simulations reported the possibility to electroporate the cell and a significant percentage of liposomes with comparable values of external electric field, when a 12 nsPEF is used.",

            "abstract": "© 2017 IBRO The neural extracellular matrix (ECM) plays an important role in regulation of perisomatic GABAergic inhibition and synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus and cortex. Decreased labeling of perineuronal nets, a form of ECM predominantly associated with parvalbumin-expressing interneurons in the brain, has been observed in post-mortem studies of schizophrenia patients, specifically, in brain areas such as prefrontal cortex, entorhinal cortex, and amygdala. Moreover, glial ECM in the form of dandelion clock-like structures was reported to be altered in schizophrenia patients. Here, we verified whether similar abnormalities in neural ECM can be reproduced in a rat model of schizophrenia, in which animals received sub-chronic administration of ketamine to reproduce the aspects of disease related to disrupted signaling through N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. Our study focused on two schizophrenia-related brain areas, namely the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and hippocampus. Semi-quantitative immunohistochemistry was performed to evaluate investigate ECM expression using Wisteria floribunda agglutinin (WFA) and CS56 antibody, both labeling distinct chondroitin sulfate epitopes enriched in perineuronal nets and glial ECM, respectively. Our analysis revealed that ketamine-treated rats exhibit reduced number of WFA-labeled perineuronal nets, and a decreased intensity of parvalbumin fluorescence in mPFC interneurons somata. Moreover, we found an increased expression of CS56 immunoreactive form of ECM. Importantly, the loss of perineuronal nets was revealed in the mPFC, and was not detected in the hippocampus, suggesting regional specificity of ECM alterations. These data open an avenue for further investigations of functional importance of ECM abnormalities in schizophrenia as well as for search of treatments for their compensation.",

In vitro microvessel models exploiting microfluidic channels have been developed to replicate cardiovascular flow conditions and to more closely mimic the blood vessels by traditionally using plasma or solvent evaporation bonding methods. The drawback of these methods is represented by an irreversible sealing which prevents internal accessibility as well as the reuse of the device. This paper presents a novel, simple, and low cost procedure to fabricate a modular and reusable chip with endotheliazed microvessels in a hybrid configuration based on poly(methyl methacrylate) and polydimethylsiloxane presenting a temporary magnetic bonding. In details, small magnets are embedded in the two poly(methyl methacrylate) substrates each of them carrying a thin polydimethylsiloxane layer which provides enhanced sealing during flow conditions as compared to conventional procedures and makes the microchannels circular as preferred in cell culture. Finally, an endothelial cell layer is formed by culturing brain endothelial bEnd.3 cells inside the proposed microchannels and characterized upon microchannel aperture, demonstrating the preservation of the cell layer.",

The results showed that the nanoparticle size was driven by the concentration of the protein. Using this approach, we obtained aqueous soluble and ultra-small crystalline nanoparticles of ≈3 nm diameter coated with protein molecules (surface coverage ≈ 5.5 pmol cm-2; zeta potential ≈-33.5 mV). These nanoparticles showed low cytotoxicity in vitro compared to chemically synthesized nanoparticles, and revealed proliferative and osteoinductive effects on human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs).

We combined spectroscopic ellipsometry, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and atomic-force microscopy in order to yield morphological and chemical information about the system. The data showed that wet-transferred samples may randomly exhibit nanosized relief patterns indicative of small water nanopockets trapped between graphene and the underlying substrate. These pockets affect the adhesion of graphene to the substrate, but can be efficiently removed upon a mild annealing in high vacuum. We show that ellipsometry is capable of successfully and reliably detecting, via multilayer dielectric modelling, both the presence of such a spurious intercalation layer and its removal. The fast, broadly applicable and non-invasive character of this technique can therefore promote its application for quickly and reliably assessing the degree of adhesion of graphene transferred onto target substrates, either for ex-post evaluation or in-line process monitoring.",

Nickel superalloys are typical materials used for the hot parts of engines in aircraft and space vehicles. They are very important in this field as they offer high-temperature mechanical strength together with a good resistance to oxidation and corrosion. Due to high-temperature buckling phenomena, reinforcement of the nickel superalloy might be needed to increase stiffness. For this reason, it was thought to investigate the possibility of producing composite materials that might improve properties of the metal at high temperature. The composite material was produced by using electrochemical deposition method in which a composite with nickel matrix and long silicon carbide fibers was deposited over the nickel superalloy. The substrate was Inconel 718, and monofilament continuous silicon carbide fibers were chosen as reinforcement. Chemical compatibility was studied between Inconel 718 and the reinforcing fibers, with fibers both in an uncoated condition, and coated with carbon or carbon/titanium diboride. Both theoretical calculations and experiments were conducted, which suggested the use of a carbon coating over the fibers and a buffer layer of nickel to avoid unwanted reactions between the substrate and silicon carbide. Deposition was then performed, and this demonstrated the practical feasibility of the process. Yield strength was measured to detect the onset of interface debonding between the substrate and the composite layer.",

High-efficiency organic photocathodes, based on a regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) and phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (rr-P3HT:PCBM) bulk heterojunction sandwiched between charge-selective layers, are emerging as efficient and low-cost devices for solar hydrogen production by water splitting. Nevertheless, stability issues of the materials used as charge-selective layers are hampering the realization of long-lasting photoelectrodes, pointing out the need to investigate novel and stable materials. Here, we propose MoS2flakes, produced by Li-aided exfoliation of the bulk counterpart, as an efficient atomic-thick hole-selective layer for rr-P3HT:PCBM-based photocathodes. We carried out p-type chemical doping to tune on-demand the MoS2Fermi level in order to match the highest occupied molecular orbital level of the rr-P3HT, thus easing the hole collection at the electrode. The as-prepared p-doped MoS2-based photocathodes reached a photocurrent of 1.21 mA cm-2at 0 V vs. RHE, a positive onset potential of 0.56 V vs. RHE and a power-saved figure of merit of 0.43%, showing a 6.1-fold increase with respect to pristine MoS2-based photocathodes, under simulated 1 sun illumination. Operational activity of the photocathodes over time and under 1 sun illumination revealed a progressive stabilization of the photocurrents at 0.49 mA cm-2at 0 V vs. RHE. These results pave the way towards the exploitation of layered crystals as efficiency-boosters for scalable hybrid organic H2-evolving photoelectrochemical cells.",

In this study, we recorded the pressure exerted onto an object by the index finger and the thumb of the preferred hand of 18 human subjects and either hand of two macaque monkeys during a precision grasping task. The to-be-grasped object was a custom-made device composed by two plates which could be variably oriented by a motorized system while keeping constant the size and thus grip dimension. The to-be-grasped plates were covered by an array of capacitive sensors to measure specific features of finger adaptation, namely pressure intensity and centroid location and displacement. Kinematic measurements demonstrated that for human subjects and for monkeys, different plate configurations did not affect wrist velocity and grip aperture during the reaching phase. Consistently, at the instant of fingers-plates contact, pressure centroids were clustered around the same point for all handle configurations. However, small pressure centroid displacements were specifically adopted for each configuration, indicating that both humans and monkeys can display finger adaptation during precision grip. Moreover, humans applied stronger thumb pressure intensity, performed less centroid displacement and required reduced adjustment time, as compared to monkeys. These pressure patterns remain similar when different load forces were required to pull the handle, as ascertained by additional measurements in humans. The present findings indicate that, although humans and monkeys share common features in motor control of grasping, they differ in the adjustment of fingertip pressure, probably because of skill and/or morphology divergences. Such a precision grip device may form the groundwork for future studies on prehension mechanisms.",

Human amniotic fluid stem cells (hAFS) have shown a distinct secretory profile and significant regenerative potential in several preclinical models of disease. Nevertheless, little is known about the detailed characterization of their secretome. Herein we show for the first time that hAFS actively release extracellular vesicles (EV) endowed with significant paracrine potential and regenerative effect. c-KIT+ hAFS were isolated from leftover samples of amniotic fluid from prenatal screening and stimulated to enhance EV release (24 hours 20% O2 versus 1% O2 preconditioning). The capacity of the c-KIT+ hAFS-derived EV (hAFS-EV) to induce proliferation, survival, immunomodulation, and angiogenesis were investigated in vitro and in vivo. The hAFS-EV regenerative potential was also assessed in a model of skeletal muscle atrophy (HSA-Cre, SmnF7/F7 mice), in which mouse AFS transplantation was previously shown to enhance muscle strength and survival. hAFS secreted EV ranged from 50 up to 1,000 nm in size. In vitro analysis defined their role as biological mediators of regenerative, paracrine effects while their modulatory role in decreasing skeletal muscle inflammation in vivo was shown for the first time. Hypoxic preconditioning significantly induced the enrichment of exosomes endowed with regenerative microRNAs within the hAFS-EV. In conclusion, this is the first study showing that c-KIT+ hAFS dynamically release EV endowed with remarkable paracrine potential, thus representing an appealing tool for future regenerative therapy.",

The complex was identified by using high-resolution (600 MHz) 1H, 31P NMR and DOSY spectroscopy, in a non-invasive fashion. The singlet at δ = 19.98 ppm (1H NMR), attributed to the alkylidene proton in the G1ST catalyst and that at δ = 53.37 ppm (31P NMR), attributed to the phosphorus atom coordinated with the metal, were selected as probes for a kinetic analysis. The intensity of these signals decreased at the expense of the singlets at 19.26 (1H NMR) and 52.68 ppm (31P NMR), diagnostic for the formation of the ruthenium-carbene-resorc[4]arene complex 3a[Ru].

Using first-principles calculations we study the interface of perovskite with TiO2 and Al2O3. We will show that the perovskite binds much stronger onto alumina than titania. We will examine the nature of the binding and prove that this is due to formation of covalent bonds to alumina versus weak non-covalent bonding to titania. We will however show that the binding onto alumina severely distorts the interface and dissociates CH3NH3 molecules. Finally we will demonstrate that the energy level alignment between perovskite and TiO2 is significantly influenced by the interfacial plane of perovskite, resulting in a much better band bending for the mesoporous cells than for the planar cells. Our findings suggest reinforcement of the perovskite/TiO2 interface as a way to increase the stability.

The decoration of the carbon-based active material with ZnO nanoparticles was investigated in order to boost the supercapacitors performance exploiting the pseudocapacitive response of this wide band-gap semiconductor. Composites of ZnO/graphite with different wt.% ZnO (such as 1, 5, 10, 20% of ZnO nanoparticles) were prepared. X-ray powder diffraction and Raman micro spectroscopy served as phase-analytical methods. Field emission scanning electron microscopy technique was used for morphology characterization of the prepared samples. The electrical characterization of the devices showed excellent results both in terms of specific capacitance and cycling and bending stability. The ease of the proposed process can allow its rapid integration in a large-scale production for efficient wearable supercapacitors. [Figure not available: see fulltext.]",

            "abstract": "© 2016 IEEE. In past decades, eye-tracking (ET) became one of the most widespread communication strategies for people with severe motor impairments (as in locked-in syndromes, LIS). ET cameras enable paralyzed patients to move a cursor across a user interface (UI) by means of their gaze, and to activate a selectable UI object after looking at it for a certain dwell time. This procedure is definitely intuitive and acceptable for many users. Nevertheless, such control function of gaze can become prone to errors if the dwell time duration is too short, not customized for each specific user. Considering such issue and the potential of brain-computer interface (BCI) systems in monitoring user's parameters like attention, it is possible to design hybrid ET-BCI solutions - labeled as EyeBCI in this paper - in order to improve the performance and the usability of ET. In this paper, a novel interaction concept is introduced to adapt the duration of the dwell time to the level of mental focus of the user of EyeBCI when he/she wants to select and activate a UI item: the dwell time shortens according to the raise of the observer's concentration, improving the system precision and responsiveness. In order to evaluate this solution, a pilot study was performed to compare different control conditions in terms of task performance and user experience: 3 ET conditions (different by duration of dwell time) and 2 EyeBCI conditions (BCI-triggered activation of UI items and BCI-modulated dwell time). The results demonstrated promising levels of performance and user experience when using the tested implementation of the novel EyeBCI. In addition, the capability of this new interaction paradigm to be self-adaptable to the user's goals has the potential to greatly enhance the usability of ET solutions for patients with LIS.",

We exploited a combination of precomputed models and machine learning owing to the principle of balancing the design effort with the complexity of data collection for learning. A first layer uses the iCub sensors to implement impedance control, on top of which we plan trajectories to reach for visually identified targets while avoiding the most obvious joint limits or self collision of the robot arm and body. Modeling errors or misestimation of parameters are compensated by machine learning in order to obtain accurate pointing and reaching movements. Motion segmentation is the main visual cue employed by the robot.",

CvxEDA, in fact, solves a convex optimization problem that always guarantees the globally optimal solution. We show that this approach is especially suitable for the implementation in wearable monitoring systems, being more computationally efficient than a widely used EDA processing algorithm. In addition, it ensures low-memory consumption, due to a sparse representation of the EDA phasic components. EDA recordings were gathered from 32 healthy subjects (16 females) who participated in an experiment where a fabric-based wearable haptic system conveyed them caress-like stimuli by means of two motors. Six types of stimuli (combining three levels of velocity and two of force) were randomly administered over time. Performance was evaluated in terms of execution time of the algorithm, memory usage, and statistical significance in discerning the affective stimuli along force and velocity dimensions. Experimental results revealed good performance of cvxEDA model for all of the considered metrics.",

            "abstract": "© 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd. We present a straightforward two-step technique for the fabrication of poly (methyl methacrylate) composites with embedded aligned magnetic chains. First, ferromagnetic microwires are realized in a poly (methyl methacrylate) solution by assembling iron nanoparticles in a methyl methacrylate solution under heat in an external magnetic field of 160 mT. The simultaneous thermal polymerization of the monomer throughout the wires is responsible for their permanent linkage and stability. Next, the polymer solution containing the randomly dispersed microwires is casted on a solid substrate in the presence of a low magnetic field (20-40 mT) which induces the final alignment of the microwires into long magnetic chains upon evaporation of the solvent. We prove that the presence of the nanoparticles assembled in the form of microwires is a key factor for the formation of the anisotropic films under low magnetic fields. In fact, such low fields are not capable of driving and assembling dispersed magnetic nanoparticles in the same type of polymer solutions. Hence, this innovative approach can be utilized for the synthesis of magnetically anisotropic nanocomposite films at low magnetic fields.",

Here we report that FUS controls back-splicing reactions leading to circular RNA (circRNA) production. We identified circRNAs expressed in in vitro-derived mouse motor neurons (MNs) and determined that the production of a considerable number of these circRNAs is regulated by FUS. Using RNAi and overexpression of wild-type and ALS-associated FUS mutants, we directly correlate the modulation of circRNA biogenesis with alteration of FUS nuclear levels and with putative toxic gain of function activities. We also demonstrate that FUS regulates circRNA biogenesis by binding the introns flanking the back-splicing junctions and that this control can be reproduced with artificial constructs. Most circRNAs are conserved in humans and specific ones are deregulated in human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived MNs carrying the FUS P525L mutation associated with ALS.",

Methods In this work, we propose the preparation of highly aligned nanocomposite fibers of gelatin/cerium oxide nanoparticles (nanoceria), prepared by electrospinning. Nanoceria are powerful self-regenerative antioxidant nanomaterials, that behave as strong reactive oxygen species scavengers, and among various beneficial effects, they have been proven to inhibit the cell senescence and to promote the neurite sprouting. Results After a detailed characterization of the developed substrates, they have been tested on neuron-like SH-SY5Y cells, demonstrating strong antioxidant properties and beneficial multi-cue effects in terms of neurite development and alignment. Conclusions Obtained findings suggest efficiency of the proposed substrates in providing combined topographical stimuli and antioxidant effects to cultured cells.

            "abstract": "© 2017 The Author(s). Background: The Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) HBx regulatory protein is required for HBV replication and involved in HBV-related carcinogenesis. HBx interacts with chromatin modifying enzymes and transcription factors to modulate histone post-translational modifications and to regulate viral cccDNA transcription and cellular gene expression. Aiming to identify genes and non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) directly targeted by HBx, we performed a chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq) to analyse HBV recruitment on host cell chromatin in cells replicating HBV. Results: ChIP-Seq high throughput sequencing of HBx-bound fragments was used to obtain a high-resolution, unbiased, mapping of HBx binding sites across the genome in HBV replicating cells. Protein-coding genes and ncRNAs involved in cell metabolism, chromatin dynamics and cancer were enriched among HBx targets together with genes/ncRNAs known to modulate HBV replication. The direct transcriptional activation of genes/miRNAs that potentiate endocytosis (Ras-related in brain (RAB) GTPase family) and autophagy (autophagy related (ATG) genes, beclin-1, miR-33a) and the transcriptional repression of microRNAs (miR-138, miR-224, miR-576, miR-596) that directly target the HBV pgRNA and would inhibit HBV replication, contribute to HBx-mediated increase of HBV replication. Conclusions: Our ChIP-Seq analysis of HBx genome wide chromatin recruitment defined the repertoire of genes and ncRNAs directly targeted by HBx and led to the identification of new mechanisms by which HBx positively regulates cccDNA transcription and HBV replication.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 Therapeutic stem cell transplantation bears the promise of new directions in organ and tissue replacement, but a number of its difficulties and perils are also well known. Our goal was to develop a method of transplantation by which the transplanted cells remain confined to the transplantation site and induce favorable processes. With the help of mask-projection excimer laser stereolithography, 3D hybrid nanoscaffolds were fabricated from biodegradable, photocurable PPF:DEF resin with incorporated gold nanoparticles (Au NPs). The scaffolds were tested in vitro and in vivo in order to find out about their biocompatibility and fitness for our purposes. In vitro, macrophages and mouse autologous adipose stem cells (ASCs) were seeded over the hybrid scaffolds and non-hybrid (with Au NPs) scaffolds for 4 days. The hybrid nanocomposite greater stem cell dispension and stem cell adhesion than PPF scaffolds without Au NPs, but such a difference was not seen in the case of macrophages. In vivo, stem cells, scaffoldings and scaffoldings covered in stem cells were transplanted under the back skin of mice. After 14 days, blood samples were taken and the affected skin area was excised. Cytokine and chemokine profiling did not indicate elevated immunomediators in the sera of experimental animals. Interestingly, the autologous-stem-cell-seeded hybrid nanocomposite scaffold induced muscle tissue regeneration after experimental wound generation in vivo. We could not observe such stem cell-induced tissue regeneration when no scaffolding was used. We conclude that PPF:DEF resin nanoscaffolds with incorporated gold nanoparticles offer a safe and efficient alternative for the enhancement of local tissue remodeling. The results also support the idea that adipose derived stem cells are an optimal cell type for the purposes of regenerative musculoskeletal tissue engineering.",

Mild heat stimulation of muscle cells within the physiological range represents an intriguing approach for the modulation of their functions. In this work, photothermal conversion was exploited to remotely stimulate striated muscle cells by using gold nanoshells (NSs) in combination with near-infrared (NIR) radiation. Temperature increments of approximately 5 °C were recorded by using an intracellular fluorescent molecular thermometer and were demonstrated to efficiently induce myotube contraction. The mechanism at the base of this phenomenon was thoroughly investigated and was observed to be a Ca2+-independent event directly involving actin-myosin interactions. Finally, chronic remote photothermal stimulations significantly increased the mRNA transcription of genes encoding heat shock proteins and sirtuin 1, a protein which in turn can induce mitochondrial biogenesis. Overall, we provide evidence that remote NIR + NS muscle excitation represents an effective wireless stimulation technique with great potential in the fields of muscle tissue engineering, regenerative medicine, and bionics.",

The modeling of word sequences enables to distinguish the meaning of utterances containing the same categories and number of words but different structures. Once the robot has learned the semantics of word sequences and derived the affordances from words physical referents, has at its disposal a grounded language model that enables the mapping of linguistic commands provided by a human tutor into the appropriate behaviors.

            "abstract": "© 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York. Neuroscientific studies show that humans tend to stabilize their head orientation, while accomplishing a locomotor task. This is beneficial to image stabilization and in general to keep a reference frame for the body. In robotics, too, head stabilization during robot walking provides advantages in robot vision and gaze-guided locomotion. In order to obtain the head movement behaviors found in human walk, it is necessary and sufficient to be able to control the orientation (roll, pitch and yaw) of the head in space. Based on these principles, three controllers have been designed. We developed two classic robotic controllers, an inverse kinematics based controller, an inverse kinematics differential controller and a bio-inspired adaptive controller based on feedback error learning. The controllers use the inertial feedback from a IMU sensor and control neck joints in order to align the head orientation with the global orientation reference. We present the results for the head stabilization controllers, on two sets of experiments, validating the robustness of the proposed control methods. In particular, we focus our analysis on the effectiveness of the bio-inspired adaptive controller against the classic robotic controllers. The first set of experiments, tested on a simulated robot, focused on the controllers response to a set of disturbance frequencies and a step function. The other set of experiments were carried out on the SABIAN robot, where these controllers were implemented in conjunction with a model of the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) and opto-kinetic reflex (OKR). Such a setup permits to compare the performances of the considered head stabilization controllers in conditions which mimic the human stabilization mechanisms composed of the joint effect of VOR, OKR and stabilization of the head. The results show that the bio-inspired adaptive controller is more beneficial for the stabilization of the head in tasks involving a sinusoidal torso disturbance, and it shows comparable performances to the inverse kinematics controller in case of the step response and the locomotion experiments conducted on the real robot",

In this study, we present a theoretical framework combining experimental characterizations and analytical calculus to capture the firing rate input-output properties of single neurons in the fluctuation-driven regime. Our framework consists of a two-step procedure to treat independently how the dendritic input translates into somatic fluctuation variables, and how the latter determine action potential firing. We use this framework to investigate the functional impact of the heterogeneity in firing responses found experimentally in young mice layer V pyramidal cells. We first design and calibrate in vitro a simplified morphological model of layer V pyramidal neurons with a dendritic tree following Rall's branching rule. Then, we propose an analytical derivation for the membrane potential fluctuations at the soma as a function of the properties of the synaptic input in dendrites. This mathematical description allows us to easily emulate various forms of synaptic input: either balanced, unbalanced, synchronized, purely proximal or purely distal synaptic activity. We find that those different forms of dendritic input activity lead to various impact on the somatic membrane potential fluctuations properties, thus raising the possibility that individual neurons will differentially couple to specific forms of activity as a result of their different firing response. We indeed found such a heterogeneous coupling between synaptic input and firing response for all types of presynaptic activity. This heterogeneity can be explained by different levels of cellular excitability in the case of the balanced, unbalanced, synchronized and purely distal activity. A notable exception appears for proximal dendritic inputs: increasing the input level can either promote firing response in some cells, or suppress it in some other cells whatever their individual excitability. This behavior can be explained by different sensitivities to the speed of the fluctuations, which was previously associated to different levels of sodium channel inactivation and density. Because local network connectivity rather targets proximal dendrites, our results suggest that this aspect of biophysical heterogeneity might be relevant to neocortical processing by controlling how individual neurons couple to local network activity.",

Microphase separation results from the system, minimizing repulsive interactions between dissimilar blocks and maximizing attractive interactions between similar blocks. Supramolecular methods have also achieved this separation by introducing small-molecule additives binding specifically to one block by noncovalent interactions. Here, we use halogen bonding as a supramolecular tool that directs the hierarchical self-assembly of low-molecular-weight perfluorinated molecules and diblock copolymers. Microphase separation results in a lamellar-within-cylindrical arrangement and promotes upright cylindrical alignment in films upon rapid casting and without further annealing. Such cylindrical domains with internal lamellar self-assemblies can be cleaved by solvent treatment of bulk films, resulting in separated and segmented cylindrical micelles stabilized by halogen-bond-based supramolecular crosslinks. These features, alongside the reversible nature of halogen bonding, provide a robust modular approach for nanofabrication.",

For a direct comparison with conventional metal electrodes, similar ultra-flexible, micro-electrocorticography (μ-ECoG) arrays with platinum (Pt) or glassy carbon (GC) electrodes were manufactured. The GC microelectrodes have more than 70% wider electrochemical window and 70% higher CTC (charge transfer capacity) than Pt microelectrodes of similar geometry. Moreover, we demonstrate that the GC microelectrodes can withstand at least 5 million pulses at 0.45 mC/cm2 charge density with less than 7.5% impedance change, while the Pt microelectrodes delaminated after 1 million pulses. Additionally, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT-PSS) was selectively electrodeposited on both sets of devices to specifically reduce their impedances for smaller diameters (&lt;60 μm). We observed that PEDOT-PSS adhered significantly better to GC than Pt, and allowed drastic reduction of electrode size while maintaining same amount of delivered current. The electrode arrays biocompatibility was demonstrated through in-vitro cell viability experiments, while acute in vivo characterization was performed in rats and showed that GC microelectrode arrays recorded somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP) with an almost twice SNR (signal-to-noise ratio) when compared to the Pt ones.",

We find that the electronic structure of LixCoO2 is significantly affected by delithiation in which the Co ions oxidation state tending to change from 3+ to 4+. The Co intersite (intrasite) 4p-3d hybridization suffers a decrease (increase) by delithiation. The unoccupied 3d t 2g orbitals with a 1g symmetry, containing substantial O 2p character, hybridize isotropically with Co 4p orbitals and likely to have itinerant character unlike anisotropically hybridized 3d e g orbitals.

In this context, control of contact forces is fundamental to ensure stable contacts and equilibrium of the robot. In this paper we propose a planning/control framework for quasi-static walking of quadrupedal robots, implemented for a demanding application in which regulation of ground reaction forces is crucial. Experimental results demonstrate that our 75-kg quadruped robot is able to walk inside two high-slope (50 ∘) V-shaped walls; an achievement that to the authors’ best knowledge has never been presented before. The robot distributes its weight among the stance legs so as to optimize user-defined criteria. We compute joint torques that result in no foot slippage, fulfillment of the unilateral constraints of the contact forces and minimization of the actuators effort. The presented study is an experimental validation of the effectiveness and robustness of QP-based force distributions methods for quasi-static locomotion on challenging terrain.",

To minimize friction during the tests at high temperature, the ends of the specimens were coated with graphite powder and a thin layer of mica was placed between the face of the specimen and the anvils. In order to investigate the warm working behavior of Zr-1%Nb alloy, all data were analysed stepwise and the step-by-step procedure was provided. The occurrence of the dynamic recrystallization (DRX) phenomena at different working conditions was analysed by the work hardening rate analysis. The stress-strain curve of many samples was identical to the typical DRX stress-strain curve which consists of a single peak stress followed by a gradual decrement toward the steady-state stress. Microstructural observations showed that at low temperatures and high strain rates the flow curves can be explained by localized deformation as a consequence of shear band formation. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis showed that the DRX has taken places through a continuous mechanism. At high Zener-Hollomon (Z) parameter a drop in flow stress was detected as a consequence of adiabatic deformation heating. The warm working constants of this alloy were determined through the general constitutive equations. Furthermore, after analyzing the work hardening behavior of this alloy, the activation energy for deformation of Zr-1%Nb alloy was calculated as 514 kJ/mol.",

The flakes are sorted by lateral size (from 380 to 75 nm) and thickness from 20 (MLG) to 2 nm (FLG) exploiting a sedimentation-based separation in centrifugal field and, finally, deposited onto Cu disks for the realization of four binder-free anodes. The electrochemical results show that decreasing lateral size and thickness leads to an increase of the initial specific capacity from ≈590 to ≈1270mAhg−1. However, an increasing irreversible capacity is also associated to the reduction of flakes’ size. We find, in addition, that the preferential Li ions storage by adsorption rather than intercalation in small lateral size (&lt;100 nm) FLG flakes has a detrimental effect on the average de-lithiation voltage, resulting on low voltage efficiency of these anodes. We believe that the results reported in this work, provide the guidelines for the practical exploitation of graphene-based electrodes.",

            "abstract": "© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2017. Human ferritins have been extensively studied to be used as nanocarriers for diverse applications and could represent a convenient alternative for targeted delivery of anticancer drugs and imaging agents. However, the most relevant limitation to their applications is the need for highly acidic experimental conditions during the initial steps of particle/cargo assembly, a process that could affect both drug stability and the complete reassembly of the ferritin cage. To overcome this issue the unique assembly of Archaeoglobus fulgidus ferritin was genetically engineered by changing a surface exposed loop of 12 amino acids connecting B and C helices to mimic the sequence of the analogous human H-chain ferritin loop. This new chimeric protein was shown to maintain the unique, cation linked, association-dissociation properties of Archaeoglobus fulgidus ferritin occurring at neutral pH values, while exhibiting the typical human H-homopolymer recognition by the transferrin receptor TfR1. The chimeric protein was confirmed to be actively and specifically internalized by HeLa cells, thus representing a unique nanotechnological tool for cell-targeted delivery of possible payloads for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes. Moreover, it was demonstrated that the 12 amino acids' loop is necessary and sufficient for binding to the transferrin receptor. The three-dimensional structure of the humanized Archaeoglobus ferritin has been obtained both as crystals by X-ray diffraction and in solution by cryo-EM.",

The proof of concept focuses on the sagittal scenario and the proposed control is effective to produce human-like balancing behaviors characterized by active foot tilting.

Nanoparticles (NPs) can contain two or more imaging tracers that allow several diagnostic techniques to be used simultaneously. In this work, a complex coacervation process to produce core-shell completely biocompatible polymeric nanoparticles (HyCoS) for multimodal imaging applications is described. Innovations on the traditional coacervation process are found in the control of the reaction temperature, allowing a speeding up of the reaction itself, and the production of a double-crosslinked system to improve the stability of the nanostructures in the presence of a clinically relevant contrast agent for MRI (Gd-DTPA). Through the control of the crosslinking behavior, an increase up to 6 times of the relaxometric properties of the Gd-DTPA is achieved. Furthermore, HyCoS can be loaded with a high amount of dye such as ATTO 633 or conjugated with a model dye such as FITC for in vivo optical imaging. The results show stable core-shell polymeric nanoparticles that can be used both for MRI and for optical applications allowing detection free from harmful radiation. Additionally, preliminary results about the possibility to trigger the release of a drug through a pH effect are reported.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma &amp; Immunology Background Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) display a therapeutic plasticity because of their ability to modulate immunity, foster tissue repair, and differentiate into mesodermal cells. IFN-γ has been described to differently affect human mesenchymal stem cell (hMSC) and mouse mesenchymal stem cell (mMSC) immunomodulation and differentiation, depending on the inflammatory milieu. Objective We aimed at dissecting the relevant intracellular pathways through which IFN-γ affects MSC plasticity and the consequence of their manipulation on MSC functions. Methods Modification of relevant IFN-γ–dependent pathways in mMSCs was carried out in vitro through gene silencing or chemical inhibition of key components. Functional outcomes were assessed by means of Western blotting, real-time PCR, differentiation, and proliferation assays on MSCs. The effect on T cells was addressed by T-cell proliferation assays; the effect of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) manipulation in MSCs was studied in vivo in a mouse model of delayed-type hypersensitivity assay. To address whether similar mechanisms are involved also in hMSCs on IFN-γ stimulation, the effect of chemical inhibition on the same intracellular pathways was assessed by means of Western blotting, and the final outcome on immunomodulatory properties was evaluated based on real-time PCR and T-cell proliferation. Results We revealed that in mMSCs IFN-γ–induced immunoregulation is mediated by early phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 1 and STAT3, which is significantly enhanced by an extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2–dependent mTOR inhibition, thereby promoting pSTAT1 nuclear translocation. Accordingly, after intracellular mTOR inhibition, MSCs augmented their ability to inhibit T-cell proliferation and control delayed-type hypersensitivity in vivo. Similarly, on mTOR blockade, hMSCs also enhanced their immunoregulatory features. A sustained exposure to IFN-γ led to inhibition of STAT3 activity, which in mMSCs resulted in an impaired proliferation and differentiation. Conclusion These results provide new insights about MSC intracellular pathways affected by IFN-γ, demonstrating that pharmacologic or genetic manipulation of MSCs can enhance their immunomodulatory functions, which could be translated into novel therapeutic approaches.",

Image foreground segmentation is a challenging task given problems due to complex background, clutter and occlusion, spectral variability in object appearance etc. Most of the techniques in this respect are semi-automatic in nature which require prior assumptions regarding the object location in the image in the form of rough bounding boxes. On the contrary, we propose a patch transfer based approach which propagates rough segmentation masks from the training to the test image patches. Further, these segmentation masks are combined and updated using a Markov random field model to generate the final foreground segmentation. The proposed technique is simple, robust and can work with very few labeled samples.

All of these algorithms try to preserve the important parts of image against distortions while producing a retargeted image with visual quality comparable with the original one. The main challenge in different algorithms is to find a suitable energy function that properly estimates the importance of each pixel in image. Hence the energy map needs to be improved. In this paper we propose a novel energy function which combines the information from saliency map, depth map and gradient map. We also present an algorithm to adaptively assign proper weights to these three importance maps for each input image. Then we calculate a switching threshold based on energy map that determines when to apply seam carving or scaling. The idea is to use a combination of seam carving and scaling to preserve the structure of important parts of image against distortion when the image size decreases beyond a point. This method reduces shape deformations and visual artifacts in salient regions of images and produces better quality output images. The results of the proposed method show superior visual quality in produced images in comparison to the state-of-the-arts.",

            "abstract": "© 2017 World Scientific Publishing Company. High-density surface microelectrodes for electrocorticography (ECoG) have become more common in recent years for recording electrical signals from the cortex. With an acceptable invasiveness/signal fidelity trade-off and high spatial resolution, micro-ECoG is a promising tool to resolve fine task-related spatial-Temporal dynamics. However, volume conduction-not a negligible phenomenon-is likely to frustrate efforts to obtain reliable and resolved signals from a sub-millimeter electrode array. To address this issue, we performed an independent component analysis (ICA) on micro-ECoG recordings of somatosensory-evoked potentials (SEPs) elicited by median nerve stimulation in three human patients undergoing brain surgery for tumor resection. Using well-described cortical responses in SEPs, we were able to validate our results showing that the array could segregate different functional units possessing unique, highly localized spatial distributions. The representation of signals through the root-mean-square (rms) maps and the signal-To-noise ratio (SNR) analysis emphasizes the advantages of adopting a source analysis approach on micro-ECoG recordings in order to obtain a clear picture of cortical activity. The implications are twofold: while on one side ICA may be used as a spatial-Temporal filter extracting micro-signal components relevant to tasks for brain-computer interface (BCI) applications, it could also be adopted to accurately identify the sites of nonfunctional regions for clinical purposes.",

These effects, in addition to the distribution of flakes in the composites, being random and locally showing multiple overlaps, cause significant Inhomogeneity in the measured work function of the graphene-based materials. To shed light on the above effects, we investigated both graphene flakes and single-layer graphene by means of scanning Kelvin probe microscopy in ambient conditions. The graphene materials were deposited on rough substrates of silver with a top layer of titanium dioxide. The roughness caused the random disorder of interest for characterization, while the thin dielectric layer of titanium dioxide helped in keeping the electric field localized and provided better contrast in the surface potential images. It is demonstrated that proper engineering of the substrate can minimize the work function inhomogeneity. Additionally, SKPM allows for local mapping of graphene flakes overlaps and thus effective thickness, for possible quality control in produced devices.",

When introduced in physiological milieus, NPs adsorb biomolecules (especially proteins) forming the so-called protein corona (PC). As it is the PC that mostly interacts with biological systems, it represents a major element of the NPs’ biological identity with impact on nanotoxicology, nanosafety and targeted delivery of nanomedicines. To date, NP-protein interactions have been largely investigated in vitro, but this condition is far from mimicking the dynamic nature of physiological environments. Here we investigate the effect of shear stress on PC by exposing lipid NPs with different surface chemistry (either unmodified and PEGylated) to circulating fetal bovine serum (FBS). PC formed upon in vitro incubation was used as a reference. We demonstrate that PC is significantly influenced by exposure to dynamic flow and that changes in PC composition are dependent on both exposure time and NP's surface chemistry. Notably, alterations induced by dynamic flow affected cellular uptake of lipid NPs in both human cervical cancer (HeLa) and human breast adenocarcinoma (MCF7) cell lines.",

            "abstract": "© 2017 American Chemical Society. The impressive photovoltaic performance of hybrid iodide CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite relies, among other factors, on the optimal alignment of the electronic energy levels of the semiconductor with respect to conventional hole transporting (HTM) and electron transporting (ETM) materials. Here, we first report on density functional theory electronic structure calculations of slab models of the (001) surface aiming to assess how the perovskite valence and conduction band edge (VBE and CBE) energies depend on the nature of the surface exposed to vacuum. We find that the surface termination plays a critical role in determining the energies of the frontier crystal orbitals, with PbI-terminated surface showing VBE and CBE energy ∼1 eV below the corresponding levels in the methylammonium-terminated surfaces. We next build perovskite/C60 interfaces based on two such surfaces and discuss the associated electronic structure in light of recent experimental data. The two interfaces are rather inert showing limited band bending/shifts with respect to the isolated components, in line with photoelectron spectroscopy data. They, however, yield very different electron extraction energies, possibly explaining the different behaviors reported in the literature.",

In situ X-ray reflectance (XRR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were employed to finely characterise palladium thin films of different thicknesses during a hydrogenation process. The derived information was combined with in-situ ellipsometric measurements to achieve a complete knowledge of both structural and optical changes during hydrogen exposure. The films expansion, crystalline structure and optical properties modifications were characterised by de-coupling the mutual effects. The structural analyses revealed that when the palladium hydride formation is completed, the films undergo a relative thickness expansion of about 8–9%. This value is considerably larger than the relative lattice parameter increase reported in the literature; in the present work this discrepancy is partly attributed to the Poisson effect. Combining such results with the ellipsometric measurements, the palladium and palladium hydride optical constants were determined.

            "abstract": "© 2017 American Chemical Society. An increasing number of studies have recently reported the rapid degradation of hybrid and all-inorganic lead halide perovskite nanocrystals under electron beam irradiation in the transmission electron microscope, with the formation of nanometer size, high contrast particles. The nature of these nanoparticles and the involved transformations in the perovskite nanocrystals are still a matter of debate. Herein, we have studied the effects of high energy (80/200 keV) electron irradiation on colloidal cesium lead bromide (CsPbBr3) nanocrystals with different shapes and sizes, especially 3 nm thick nanosheets, a morphology that facilitated the analysis of the various ongoing processes. Our results show that the CsPbBr3 nanocrystals undergo a radiolysis process, with electron stimulated desorption of a fraction of bromine atoms and the reduction of a fraction of Pb2+ ions to Pb0. Subsequently Pb0 atoms diffuse and aggregate, giving rise to the high contrast particles, as previously reported by various groups. The diffusion is facilitated by both high temperature and electron beam irradiation. The early stage Pb nanoparticles are epitaxially bound to the parent CsPbBr3 lattice, and evolve into nonepitaxially bound Pb crystals upon further irradiation, leading to local amorphization and consequent dismantling of the CsPbBr3 lattice. The comparison among CsPbBr3 nanocrystals with various shapes and sizes evidences that the damage is particularly pronounced at the corners and edges of the surface, due to a lower diffusion barrier for Pb0 on the surface than inside the crystal and the presence of a larger fraction of under-coordinated atoms.",

Poly(ω-OHC16)s obtained are characterized as polyesters by infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and solid state magic angle spinning 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (13C MAS-NMR). Structurally, poly(ω-OHC16)s are quite crystalline as revealed by wide angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD). The presence of oxygen in the reaction atmosphere causes a mild oxidation in the form of peroxyester species, tentatively at the interphase between poly(ω-OHC16) crystallites, and the structure amorphization. The interfacial peroxyester phase ends up in the encapsulation of the polyester grains and provides a barrier towards the action of solvents. Thermal stabilization and insolubility resulting from the synthesis conditions used are interesting features to prepare solvent and heat resistant poly(ω-OHC16) coatings.

Visual information is extremely important to generate internal spatial representations. In the auditory modality, the absence of visual cues during early infancy does not preclude the development of some spatial strategies. However, specific spatial abilities might result impaired. In the current study, we investigated the effect of early visual deprivation on the ability to localize static and moving auditory stimuli by comparing sighted and early blind individuals' performance in different spatial tasks. We also examined perceptual stability in the two groups of participants by matching localization accuracy in a static and a dynamic head condition that involved rotational head movements. Sighted participants accurately localized static and moving sounds. Their localization ability remained unchanged after rotational movements of the head. Conversely, blind participants showed a leftward bias during the localization of static sounds and a little bias for moving sounds. Moreover, head movements induced a significant bias in the direction of head motion during the localization of moving sounds. These results suggest that internal spatial representations might be bodycentered in blind individuals and that in sighted people the availability of visual cues during early infancy may affect sensory-motor interactions.",

The design of hybrid organic/inorganic nanostructures with controlled assembly drives the development of materials with new or improved properties and superior performances. In this paper, the surface and internal structure of hybrid ZnO poly-N-vinylpyrrolidone (ZnO/PVP) mesocrystals are investigated in detail and correlated with their emitting properties. A photoluminescence study at room temperature reveals that the as-synthesized particles show a remarkable ultraviolet (UV) emission, whereas an emission from defects in the visible region is not observed. On the other hand, a visible emission is achieved upon calcination of the hybrid ZnO/PVP particles in air, and its intensity is found to increase with the calcination temperature and, in some cases, to overwhelm the UV emission. A molecular description is proposed for the absence of a visible emission from defects in the as-synthesized ZnO/PVP mesocrystals on the basis of Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and solid-state 13C NMR (SSNMR) spectroscopy. An in-depth electron microscopy study sheds light on the internal organization of mesocrystals and reveals the formation of nanoreactors, that is, particles with enclosed porosity, upon thermal treatment.",

            "abstract": "© 2017 Kia, Vega Pons, Weisz and Passerini. Brain decoding is a popular multivariate approach for hypothesis testing in neuroimaging. Linear classifiers are widely employed in the brain decoding paradigm to discriminate among experimental conditions. Then, the derived linear weights are visualized in the form of multivariate brain maps to further study spatio-temporal patterns of underlying neural activities. It is well known that the brain maps derived from weights of linear classifiers are hard to interpret because of high correlations between predictors, low signal to noise ratios, and the high dimensionality of neuroimaging data. Therefore, improving the interpretability of brain decoding approaches is of primary interest in many neuroimaging studies. Despite extensive studies of this type, at present, there is no formal definition for interpretability of multivariate brain maps. As a consequence, there is no quantitative measure for evaluating the interpretability of different brain decoding methods. In this paper, first, we present a theoretical definition of interpretability in brain decoding; we show that the interpretability of multivariate brain maps can be decomposed into their reproducibility and representativeness. Second, as an application of the proposed definition, we exemplify a heuristic for approximating the interpretability in multivariate analysis of evoked magnetoencephalography (MEG) responses. Third, we propose to combine the approximated interpretability and the generalization performance of the brain decoding into a new multi-objective criterion for model selection. Our results, for the simulated and real MEG data, show that optimizing the hyper-parameters of the regularized linear classifier based on the proposed criterion results in more informative multivariate brain maps. More importantly, the presented definition provides the theoretical background for quantitative evaluation of interpretability, and hence, facilitates the development of more effective brain decoding algorithms in the future.",

All rights reserved.The neuropeptides oxytocin (OXT) and vasopressin (AVP) have been identified as modulators of emotional social behaviors and associated with neuropsychiatric disorders characterized by social dysfunction. Experimental and therapeutic use of OXT and AVP via the intranasal route is the subject of extensive clinical research. However, the large-scale functional substrates directly engaged by these peptides and their functional dynamics remain elusive. By using cerebral blood volume (CBV) weighted fMRI in the mouse, we show that intranasal administration of OXT rapidly elicits the transient activation of cortical regions and a sustained activation of hippocampal and forebrain areas characterized by high oxytocin receptor density. By contrast, intranasal administration of AVP produced a robust and sustained deactivation in cortico-parietal, thalamic and mesolimbic regions. Importantly, intravenous administration of OXT and AVP did not recapitulate the patterns of modulation produced by intranasal dosing, supporting a central origin of the observed functional changes. In keeping with this notion, hippocampal local field potential recordings revealed multi-band power increases upon intranasal OXT administration. We also show that the selective OXT-derivative TGOT reproduced the pattern of activation elicited by OXT and that the deletion of OXT receptors does not affect AVP-mediated deactivation. Collectively, our data document divergent modulation of brainwide neural systems by intranasal administration of OXT and AVP, an effect that involves key substrates of social and emotional behavior. The observed divergence calls for a deeper investigation of the systems-level mechanisms by which exogenous OXT and AVP modulate brain function and exert their putative therapeutic effects.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 Elsevier B.V. Radio-guided surgery (RGS) is a technique to intraoperatively detect tumour remnants, favouring a radical resection. Exploiting β− emitting tracers provides a higher signal to background ratio compared to the established technique with γ radiation, allowing the extension of the RGS applicability range. We developed and tested a detector based on para-terphenyl scintillator with high sensitivity to low energy electrons and almost transparent to γs to be used as intraoperative probe for RGS with β− emitting tracer. Portable read out electronics was customised to match the surgeon needs. This probe was used for preclinical test on specific phantoms and a test on “ex vivo” specimens from patients affected by meningioma showing very promising results for the application of this new technique on brain tumours. In this paper, the prototype of the intraoperative probe and the tests are discussed; then, the results on meningioma are used to make predictions on the performance of the probe detecting residuals of a more challenging and more interesting brain tumour: the glioma.",

            "abstract": "© 2017 The Author(s). Background: The brain is continuously targeted by a wealth of stimuli with complex spatio-temporal patterns and has presumably evolved in order to cope with those inputs in an optimal way. Previous studies investigating the response capabilities of either single neurons or intact sensory systems to external stimulation demonstrated that stimuli temporal distribution is an important, if often overlooked, parameter. Results: In this study we investigated how cortical networks plated over micro-electrode arrays respond to different stimulation sequences in which inter-pulse intervals followed a 1/f β distribution, for different values of β ranging from 0 to ∞. Cross-correlation analysis revealed that network activity preferentially synchronizes with external input sequences featuring β closer to 1 and, in any case, never for regular (i.e. fixed-frequency) stimulation sequences. We then tested the interplay between different average stimulation frequencies (based on the intrinsic firing/bursting frequency of the network) for two selected values of β, i.e. 1 (scale free) and ∞ (regular). In general, we observed no preference for stimulation frequencies matching the endogenous rhythms of the network. Moreover, we found that in case of regular stimulation the capability of the network to follow the stimulation sequence was negatively correlated to the absolute stimulation frequency, whereas using scale-free stimulation cross-correlation between input and output sequences was independent from average input frequency. Conclusions: Our results point out that the preference for a scale-free distribution of the stimuli is observed also at network level and should be taken into account in designing more efficient protocols for neuromodulation purposes.",

            "abstract": "© 2016, Springer-Verlag London. Selective laser melting (SLM) process, an additive manufacturing (AM) technology, has had a rapid growth in the biomedical and aerospace markets because of the ability to manufacture complex designs directly from computer-aided design (CAD) using materials such as titanium and aluminum alloys. Although this technology allows designers to fabricate geometries not achievable with conventional manufacturing, it has some restrictions. The paper presents the technological problems and restrictions resulting in the production of structures in aluminum alloy by SLM. In particular, it analyzed the input file of the process,.STL file, and the dimensional limits of geometries with sharp edges as a simple parallelepiped with a square base since the understanding of the limitations can help the designer in the creation of new components. The creation of function-independent design rules, easily transferrable on individual part designs, could allow a wide industrial usage and a better knowledge of AM technologies. The results presented in this paper showed that the choice of parameters of conversion from the CAD model to.STL file could be a restriction for the software for preprocessing part but also affects the surface roughness. Moreover, if a SLM machine with a laser beam of 100 μm is used, it is not possible to produce geometries with sharp edges with size base below 0.8 mm in an aluminum alloy.",

In physiological environments (e.g. the blood), nanoparticles (NPs) are surrounded by a layer of biomolecules referred to as a 'protein corona' (PC). The most tightly NP-bound proteins form the so-called hard corona (HC), the key bio-entity that determines the NP's biological identity and physiological response. To date, NP-HC has been almost exclusively characterized in vitro, while NP-protein interactions under realistic in vivo conditions remain largely unexplored. In this study, we thoroughly characterized the in vivo HC of a NP formulation that forms around lipid nanoparticles with a lipid composition equal to that of clinically used liposomal amphotericin B (AmBisome®) after the recovery of the NPs from the blood circulation of FVB/N mice 10 minutes post intravenous administration. In vitro HC formed by 10 minutes incubation of NPs in FVB/N mouse plasma was used for comparison. Here we show that the biological identity (i.e. size, zeta-potential and aggregation state) of NPs in vivo is significantly different from that acquired in vitro. Furthermore, the variety of protein species in the in vivo HC was considerably larger. The present work has demonstrated that characterization of the in vivo HC is essential to provide an accurate molecular description of the biological identity of NPs in physiological environments.",

One of the mechanisms responsible for cancer-induced increased blood supply in malignant neoplasms is the overexpression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Several antibodies for VEGF targeting have been produced for both imaging and therapy. Molecularly imprinted polymer nanoparticles, nanoMIPs, however, offer significant advantages over antibodies, in particular in relation to improved stability, speed of design, cost and control over functionalization. In the present study, the successful production of nanoMIPs against human VEGF is reported for the first time. NanoMIPs were coupled with quantum dots (QDs) for cancer imaging. The composite nanoparticles exhibited specific homing toward human melanoma cell xenografts, overexpressing hVEGF, in zebrafish embryos. No evidence of this accumulation was observed in control organisms. These results indicate that nanoMIPs are promising materials which can be considered for advancing molecular oncological research, in particular when antibodies are less desirable due to their immunogenicity or long production time.",

Here, we report the fabrication of a fully innervated human skin tissue in vitro that recapitulates and replicates skin sensory function. Previous attempts to innervate in vitro 3D skin models did not demonstrate an effective functionality of the nerve network. In our approach, we initially engineer functional human skin tissue based on fibroblast-generated dermis and differentiated epidermis; then, we promote rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons axon ingrowth in the de-novo developed tissue. Neurofilaments network infiltrates the entire native dermis extracellular matrix (ECM), as demonstrated by immunofluorescence and second harmonic generation (SHG) imaging. To prove sensing functionality of the tissue, we use topical applications of capsaicin, an agonist of transient receptor protein-vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) channel, and quantify calcium currents resulting from variations of Ca++ concentration in DRG neurons innervating our model. Calcium currents generation demonstrates functional cross-talking between dermis and epidermis compartments. Moreover, through a computational fluid dynamic (CFD) analysis, we set fluid dynamic conditions for a non-planar skin equivalent growth, as proof of potential application in creating skin grafts tailored on-demand for in vivo wound shape.",

The color of the resulting hydrogel-like ordered structures can be continuously shifted over the entire visible range (405-760 nm) by changing the content of ions over an extremely wide range of concentration (from about 70 μM to 4 M). The optical response is completely independent from pH and temperature, and the initial color can be fully recovered by washing the sulfonated opals with pure water.

To this end, we propose Kernelized-COV, which generalizes the original covariance representation without compromising the efficiency of the computation. In the experiments, we validate the proposed framework against many previous approaches in the literature, scoring on par or superior with respect to the state of the art on benchmark datasets for 3D action recognition.",

Material related to the self, as well as to significant others, often displays mnemonic superiority through its associations with highly organised and elaborate representations. Neuroimaging studies suggest this effect is related to activation in regions of medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Incidental memory scores for trait adjectives, processed in relation to the self, a good friend and David Cameron were collected. Scores for each referent were used as regressors in seed-based analyses of resting state fMRI data performed in ventral, middle and dorsal mPFC seeds, as well as hippocampal formation. Stronger memory for self-processed items was predicted by functional connnectivity between ventral mPFC, angular gyrus and middle temporal gyri. These regions are within the default mode network, linked to relatively automatic aspects of memory retrieval. In contrast, memory for items processed in relation to best friends, was better in individuals whose ventral mPFC showed relatively weak connectivity with paracingulate gyrus as well as positive connectivity with lateral prefrontal and parietal regions associated with controlled retrieval. These results suggest that mechanisms responsible for memory related to ourselves and personally-familiar people are partially dissociable and reflect connections between ventral mPFC, implicated in schema-based memory, and regions implicated in more automatic and controlled aspects of retrieval.",

Ablation of endogenous Lamin B1 (Lmnb1) in the mouse strongly impairs embryonic brain development and corticogenesis. However, the mechanisms underlying these neurodevelopmental effects are unknown. Here, we report that Lamin B1 levels modulate the differentiation of murine neural stem cells (NSCs) into neurons and astroglial-like cells. In vitro, endogenous Lmnb1 depletion favors NSC differentiation into glial fibrillar acidic protein (GFAP)-immunoreactive cells over neurons, while overexpression of human Lamin B1 (LMNB1) increases the proportion of neurons. In Lmnb1-null embryos, neurogenesis is reduced, while in vivo Lmnb1 silencing in mouse embryonic brain by in utero electroporation of a specific Lmnb1 sh-RNA results in aberrant cortical positioning of neurons and increased expression of the astrocytic marker GFAP in the cortex of 7-day old pups. Together, these results indicate that finely tuned levels of Lamin B1 are required for NSC differentiation into neurons, proper expression of the astrocytic marker GFAP and corticogenesis.",

This is especially true for subsystem DFT, where these models are necessary to construct the required non-additive embedding contributions. In particular, these models can also be efficiently employed to replace the exact KED in meta-Generalized Gradient Approximation (meta-GGA) exchange-correlation functionals allowing to extend the subsystem DFT applicability to the meta-GGA level of theory. Here, we present a two-dimensional scan of semilocal KED models as linear functionals of the reduced gradient and of the reduced Laplacian, for atoms and weakly bound molecular systems. We find that several models can perform well but in any case the Laplacian contribution is extremely important to model the local features of the KED. Indeed a simple model constructed as the sum of Thomas-Fermi KED and 1/6 of the Laplacian of the density yields the best accuracy for atoms and weakly bound molecular systems. These KED models are tested within subsystem DFT with various meta-GGA exchange-correlation functionals for non-bonded systems, showing a good accuracy of the method.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 Elsevier Ltd Nanoscale materials have long promised to revolutionize science and technology, with claims being sustained by both the advances in their fabrication and by the many fundamental studies that have been carried out to date, which have revealed fascinating properties when materials dimensions shrink all the way down to a few hundreds/thousands of atoms. In this ongoing hype, on one side we have the futuristic views and promises of ubiquitous devices in which the operating units will be eventually scaled down to individual atoms or molecules. On the other side, we have the more realistic (and already unfolding) scenario represented by nanoscale materials making their way in a wide variety of applications (not always and not necessarily flagged as “high-tech”) where downsizing truly brings about new or improved features that can be immediately exploited for some practical use. These applications have encompassed fields as disparate as medicine, biology, energy conversion and storage, catalysis, sensing, nanocomposite engineering, cosmetics, to cite the most popular ones. For a new technology to be pervasive and disruptive, the costs associated to the fabrication, the characterization and the assemblage of its key components have to drop quickly over time, while at the same time the material quality and the reproducibility of the various processes must keep improving. In the case of nanomaterials, we have not yet witnessed such an ubiquitous revolution, and one of the reasons is probably the lack of straightforward and reproducible synthetic protocols providing large amounts of nanomaterials and thus capable of efficient up-scaling to fulfil industrial needs. Another reason likely resides in the growing concern that nanomaterials will pose new threats to the environment, but this aspect will not be investigated here. In this review, we will touch upon the critical feature of nanomaterials science and engineering dealing with the high throughput synthesis, with a focus on materials prepared in the liquid phase, where the expertise of the authors of this review lays. As a note of caution to the reader, we will not cover in depth all existing approaches to large scale syntheses. Our discussion will be instead a broad summary of the main types of synthetic approaches developed to date, and which we believe will be useful to scientists and engineers who are approaching the fabrication of nanomaterials with an eye on their use in large-scale, industrial applications. The review has been written according to the principle “from the simple to the complex”: it begins with the simplest one-batch heat-up synthesis approach, followed by hot-injection methods and ends by discussing the more sophisticated continuous flow syntheses of nanoparticles. Similarly, in each section, wherever possible, the discussion will start from simpler compounds, (for example, one-component noble metal nanocrystals), and will then move on to more complex structures (from binary to ternary and even quaternary compounds, which will be mainly metal oxides and chalcogenides).",

The crystal structure, chemical composition, electric and piezoelectric properties of the films were investigated either on the as-grown thin films or after a post-deposition rapid thermal annealing (RTA) treatment performed at 600 °C for different lengths of time (1 and 5 min) in an oxygen atmosphere. Substitutional doping of Zn2+ with V3+ and V5+ ions strongly deteriorated the hexagonal wurtzite ZnO structure of the as-grown thin films due to lattice distortion. The resulting slight amorphization led to a poor piezoelectric response and higher resistivity. After the RTA treatment, strong c-axis oriented VZO thin films were obtained, together with a partial conversion of the starting V3+ ions into V5+. The improvement of the crystal structure and the stronger polarity of both V3+-O and V5+-O chemical bonds, together with the corresponding easier rotation under the application of an external electric field, positively affected the piezoelectric response and increased conductivity. This was confirmed by closed-loop butterfly piezoelectric curves, by a maximum d 33 piezoelectric coefficient of 85 pm·V â '1, and also by ferroelectric switching domains with a well-defined polarization hysteresis curve, featuring a residual polarization of 12.5 μcm-2.",

This paper presents a novel strategy to learn a positional controller for the body of a flexible surgical manipulator used for minimally invasive surgery. The manipulator is developed within the STIFF-FLOP European project and is targeted for a laparoscopic use in remote areas of the abdominal region that are not easily accessible by means of currently available rigid tools. While the surgeon controls the end-effector during the task, the flexible body of the manipulator needs to be displaced to enter inside constrained spaces by efficiently exploiting its flexibility, without touching vital organs and structures. The proposed algorithm exploits the instruments of machine learning within the programming by demonstrations paradigm to produce a statistical model of the natural movements of the surgeon during the task. The gathered information is then reused to determine a controller in the null space of the robot that does not interfere with the surgeon task and displaces the robot body within the available space in a fully automated manner.",

In practice, this can happen only after a rigorous certification process which ensures that several requirements, e.g., operation safety, are met. Automated verification of control programs can be part of cost-effective methodologies to support certification, but it is widely recognized as difficult to attain in robotics, because of several traits that characterize robot design and implementation. One such trait is the widespread usage of middleware to implement control programs in a distributed fashion. In these cases, the challenge of verification is made steep mainly by the fact that the correctness of control software depends on middleware components whose structured models might not be available, or too difficult to obtain from their documentation. Our proposal is to ease the application of automated verification techniques by identifying abstract middleware models in the form of finite-state automata. The identification procedure is itself largely automated, and the only prerequisite is for the middleware to be available for controlled experimentation. Once middleware models are computed, behaviors that would lead to unsafe operation can be spotted automatically on a composition of identified middleware and control software models using model checking techniques. The approach is based on our tool AIDE – Automata IDentification Engine – to identify abstract middleware models, and the model checker SPIN to verify control units. To validate our approach, we consider four different case studies built on YARP publish–subscribe middleware. Our results confirm that AIDE enables the extension of precise engineering methods to distributed control software in robotics.",

            "abstract": "© 2017 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg Wedge prisms shifting the visual field laterally create a mismatch between the straight ahead position signalled by vision and that encoded by extraretinal and head-on-trunk proprioceptive information. Short-term adaptation to left-deviating prisms in normal subjects results in a visuomotor attentional bias towards the right-hand side (aftereffect). Prismatic adaptation (PA) is usually induced through a training consisting in repeated ballistic movements of the dominant arm towards visual targets, while participants are wearing prismatic goggles. The present study demonstrates that an original oculomotor PA procedure with leftward deviating prisms—without pointing movements and only consisting in repeated gaze shifts towards visual targets—can induce a rightward bias in normal subjects as assessed by visual straight ahead and line bisection tasks (Experiments 1 and 2). We show that oculomotor PA induces a bias in line bisection similar to that reported after visuomotor PA (Experiment 2). We suggest that a conflict between retinal, extraretinal and proprioceptive information about the straight ahead location causes the observed effects. In follow-up experiments 3, 4, and 5, we demonstrate that neither eye deviation without prisms nor shift of the visual field without eye deviation induces PA biases. We propose that an optimal integration model of visual and proprioceptive inputs can best account for the observed results.",

LMTK2 is a poorly characterized serine/threonine kinase believed to play a role in endosomal membrane trafficking and neuronal physiology, and recently found to be mutated in diverse tumor types. We show that LMTK2 silencing sensitizes immortalized epithelial cells and cancer cells to TRAIL, and this phenomenon is accompanied by changes in the expression of BCL2 family members. In epithelial cells, LMTK2 targeting causes the down-regulation of the BCL2 and BCL-xL anti-apoptotic proteins and the reciprocal up-regulation of the pro-apoptotic protein BIM, while, in cancer cells, LMTK2 knock-down reduces BCL2 without increasing BIM levels. We provide evidence that both BIM and BCL2 proteins are regulated by LMTK2 in a GSK3β- and PP1A-dependent manner and that their perturbation, together with BCL-xL reduction, determines an increased sensitivity not only to TRAIL, but also to other compounds. Overall, our findings suggest a broad function of LMTK2 in the regulation of the apoptotic pathway and highlight LMTK2 as a novel candidate target to increase the cytotoxic activity of chemotherapeutic compounds.",

            "abstract": "© 2017 Elsevier B.V. Human monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) is a membrane-interacting enzyme that generates pro-inflammatory signaling molecules. For this reason, MAGL inhibition is a promising strategy to treat pain, cancer, and neuroinflammatory diseases. MAGL can hydrolyze monoacylglycerols bearing an acyl chain of different lengths and degrees of unsaturation, cleaving primarily the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol. Importantly, the enzymatic binding site of MAGL is confined by a 75-amino-acid-long, flexible cap domain, named ‘lid domain’, which is structurally similar to that found in several other lipases. However, it is unclear how lid domain plasticity affects catalysis in MAGL. By integrating extensive molecular dynamics simulations and free-energy calculations with mutagenesis and kinetic experiments, we here define a lid-domain-mediated mechanism for substrate selection and binding in MAGL catalysis. In particular, we clarify the key role of Phe159 and Ile179, two conserved residues within the lid domain, in regulating substrate specificity in MAGL. We conclude by proposing that other structurally related lipases may share this lid-domain-mediated mechanism for substrate specificity.",

In this work, Disperse Red 1 (DR1)-based photoresponsive polymer brushes were synthesised using a controlled radical polymerisation technique. A sinusoidal pattern was inscribed on the azopolymer brush samples using Lloyd's IL configuration. Interestingly, we found that seeded human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) oriented in the pattern direction.

The synthetic strategy involves the preparation of epoxy monomers with photolabile o-nitrobenzyl ester (o-NBE) links that are cured via photoinduced cationic ring opening reaction. Two different photoinitiation systems are employed which do not interfere with the absorbance of the o-NBE groups. The first initiation mechanism exploits the direct photolysis of N-hydroxynaphthalimide triflate upon deep UV exposure and the second mechanism follows a free radical promoted cationic polymerization upon visible light illumination. The crosslinking and cleavage kinetics of the photodegradable epoxy networks are characterized by spectroscopic techniques. In thin films, the UV induced increase in solubility is confirmed by sol-gel analysis and used for the fabrication of positive tone photoresists. Patterned films are obtained by photolithographic processes and microscopic analyses reveal that the resists provide a resolution of 4 μm and a good contrast behavior.",

Yet, a conventional mRNA vaccine comprising of condensed mRNA molecules in a positively charged protein core structure is not effectively internalized by the antigen-presenting cells. It cannot offer sufficient protection for mRNA molecules from degradation by plasma and tissue enzymes either. Here, we have developed a lipopolyplex mRNA vaccine that consists of a poly-(β-amino ester) polymer mRNA core encapsulated into a 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-ethylphosphocholine/1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidyl-ethanolamine/1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[amino(polyethylene glycol)-2000 (EDOPC/DOPE/DSPE-PEG) lipid shell. This core-shell structured mRNA vaccine enters dendritic cells through macropinocytosis. It displayed intrinsic adjuvant activity by potently stimulating interferon-β and interleukin-12 expression in dendritic cells through Toll-like receptor 7/8 signaling. Dendritic cells treated with the mRNA vaccine displayed enhanced antigen presentation capability. Mice bearing lung metastatic B16-OVA tumors expressing the ovalbumin antigen were treated with the lipopolyplex mRNA, and over 90% reduction of tumor nodules was observed. Collectively, this core-shell structure offers a promising platform for mRNA vaccine development.",

Here we integrated dipole antennas with field-effect transistors based on a two-dimensional electron gas, with the specific aim of rectifying free-space radiation exploiting both artificial and natural nonlinearities. In the present work, resonant conditions of antenna-coupled field-effect rectifiers have been identified in a terahertz experiment based on the well-established GaAs transistor technology. Rectification of free-space radiation has been observed in a broad 0.15-0.40 THz range by implementing quasi-optical coupling with a substrate lens to an AlGaAs/GaAs heterostructure transistor into the gap of a cross-dipole antenna. The short- and the open-circuit resonances have been clearly identified through a comparison between experimental photocurrent spectra, electromagnetic simulations, and antenna models. The former depends only on the dipole antenna geometry, while the latter is determined by the impedance matching between the antenna and the integrated device and, as such, can be even tuned to the desired frequency by applying a dc gate bias. In addition, the high-mobility two-dimensional electron gas supports plasma wave cavity resonances featuring natural hydrodynamic nonlinearity. The resonant peaks corresponding to the different rectification mechanisms have been identified and discussed in terms of simple lumped-element models. The demonstrated concepts are extrapolated toward infrared frequencies, where novel application demands and novel two-dimensional electron gas materials for antenna-coupled rectifiers are emerging.",

The anomalous thickness observed after the graphene oxidation process is linked to the impact of LAO on the substrate. Micro-Raman (μ-Raman) spectroscopy was employed to demonstrate the presence of two oxidation regimes depending on the applied bias. We show that partial and total etching of monolayer graphene can be achieved by tuning the bias voltage during LAO.

Neglecting spin polarization, an extremely flat surface band centered at the special point K of the Brillouin zone occurs at the Fermi level. Spin polarization opens a gap in the surface state by stabilizing an antiferromagnetic state. The top and the bottom surface layers are weakly ferrimagnetic in-plane (net magnetization smaller than 10-3μB) and are antiferromagnetic coupled to each other. This coupling is propagated by the out-of-plane antiferromagnetic coupling between the nearest neighbors. The gap is very small in a spin-polarized generalized gradient approximation, while it is proportional to the amount of exact exchange in hybrid functionals. For trilayer rhombohedral graphene it is 38.6 meV in PBE0, in agreement with the 42 meV gap found in experiments. We study the temperature and doping dependence of the magnetic gap. At electron doping of n∼7×1011 cm-2 the gap closes. Charge density wave instabilities with 3×3 periodicity do not occur.",

In this work, we present a robotic model for grounding abstract action words (i.e. USE, MAKE) through the hierarchical organization of terms directly linked to perceptual and motor skills of a humanoid robot. Experimental results have shown that the robot, in response to linguistic commands, is capable of performing the appropriate behaviors on objects.

Dissecting the corresponding, often overlapping, spectroscopic signals from different electronic states is a challenge hampering their interpretation. Here we address impulsive stimulated Raman spectroscopy (ISRS), a powerful technique able to coherently stimulate and record Raman-active modes using broadband pulses. Using a quantum-mechanical treatment of the ISRS process, we show the mode-specific way the various spectral components of the broadband probe contribute to the signal generated at a given wavelength. We experimentally demonstrate how to manipulate the signal by varying the probe chirp and the phase-matching across the sample, thereby affecting the relative phase between the various contributions to the signal. These novel control knobs allow us to selectively enhance desired vibrational features and distinguish spectral components arising from different excited states.",

Here we explore the mechanisms of action of multicomponent (MC) cationic liposome/DNA complexes (lipoplexes) by a combination of reporter technologies, dynamic light scattering (DLS), synchrotron small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis and laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) in live cells. Lipofectamine – the gold standard among transfection reagents – was used as a reference. On the basis of our results, we suggest that an additional transfection barrier impairs transfection efficiency, that is: low lipoplex concentration at the cell surface. Based on the acquired knowledge we propose an optimized transfection protocol that allowed us to efficiently transfect DND41, JURKAT, MOLT3, P12-ICHIKAWA, ALL-SILL, TALL-1 human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cell lines known to be difficult-to-transfect by using non-viral vectors and where LFN-based technologies fail to give satisfactory results.",

Two-photon (2P) lithography shows great potential for the fabrication of three-dimensional (3-D) micro- and nanomechanical elements, for applications ranging from microelectromechanical systems to tissue engineering, by virtue of its high resolution (&lt;100 nm) and biocompatibility of the photosensitive resists. However, there is a considerable lack of quantitative data on mechanical properties of materials for 2P lithography and of structures obtained through this technique. In this paper, we combined static and dynamic mechanical analysis on purpose-designed microstructures (microbending of pillar-like structures and picometer-sensitive laser Doppler vibrometry of drum-like structures) to viably and nondestructively estimate Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, and density of materials for 2P lithography. This allowed us to analyze several polymeric photoresists, including acrylates and epoxy-based materials. The experiments reveal that the 2P exposure power is a key parameter to define the stiffness of the realized structures, with hyperelasticity clearly observable for high-power polymerization. In the linear elastic regime, some of the investigated materials are characterized by a quasi-linear dependence of Young's modulus on the used exposure power, a yet unknown behavior that adds a new degree of freedom to engineer complex 3-D micro- and nanomechanical elements.",

To investigate how the dynamic of assembly and disassembly of focal adhesion are influenced by the substrate mechanics we developed a novel procedure. The analysis consists of the over time tracking of focal adhesion structures in a stable cell line of NIH/3T3 expressing fluorescent pmKate2-paxillin. From collected signals and by their autocorrelation we evaluated the average lifetime and assembly rate of focal adhesion as function of substrate stiffness. Further, by signals cross-correlation we obtained information about the mechanical nature of cytoskeleton and its network.

            "abstract": "IEEE This paper addresses 6-DOF (degree-of-freedom) tactile localization, i.e., the pose estimation of tridimensional objects using tactile measurements. This estimation problem is fundamental for the operation of autonomous robots that are often required to manipulate and grasp objects whose pose is a priori unknown. The nature of tactile measurements, the strict time requirements for real-time operation, and the multimodality of the involved probability distributions pose remarkable challenges and call for advanced nonlinear filtering techniques. Following a Bayesian approach, this paper proposes a novel and effective algorithm, named memory unscented particle filter (MUPF), which solves 6-DOF localization recursively in real time by only exploiting contact point measurements. The MUPF combines a modified particle filter that incorporates a sliding memory of past measurements to better handle multimodal distributions, along with the unscented Kalman filter that moves the particles toward regions of the search space that are more likely with the measurements. The performance of the proposed MUPF algorithm has been assessed both in simulation and on a real robotic system equipped with tactile sensors (i.e., the iCub humanoid robot). The experiments show that the algorithm provides accurate and reliable localization even with a low number of particles and, hence, is compatible with real-time requirements.",

KGaA, Weinheim.Atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disorder characterized by the progressive thickening of blood vessel walls eventually resulting in acute vascular syndromes. Here, intravenously injectable hybrid nanoconstructs are synthesized for tempering immune cell inflammation locally and systemically. Lipid and polymer chains are nanoprecipitated to form 100 nm spherical polymeric nanoconstructs (SPNs), loaded with methotrexate (MTX) and subsequently labeled with Cu64 and fluorescent probes for combined nuclear/optical imaging. Upon engulfment into macrophages, MTX SPNs intracellularly release their anti-inflammatory cargo significantly lowering the production of proinflammatory cytokine (interleukin 6 and tumor necrosis factor α) already at 0.06 mg mL-1 of MTX. In ApoE-/- mice, fed with high-fat diet up to 17 weeks, nuclear and optical imaging demonstrates specific accumulation of SPNs within lipid-rich plaques along the arterial tree. Histological analyses confirm SPN uptake into macrophages residing within atherosclerotic plaques. A 4-week treatment with biweekly administration of MTX SPNs is sufficient to reduce the plaque burden in ApoE-/- mice by 50%, kept on high-fat diet for 10 weeks. Systemic delivery of MTX to macrophages via multifunctional, hybrid nanoconstructs constitutes an effective strategy to inhibit atherosclerosis progression and induce, potentially, the resorption of vascular lesions.",

Despite the existence of several mixers capable of stirring and stretching the flows to promote mixing, most approaches sacrifice temporal or spatial control, portability, or flexibility in terms of operating flow rates. Here, we report a novel method for rapid micromixing based on the generation of cavitation bubbles. By using a portable battery-powered electric circuit, we induce a localized electric spark between two tip electrodes perpendicular to the flow channel that results in several cavitation events. As a result, a vigorous stirring mechanism is induced. We investigate the spatiotemporal dynamics of the spark-generated cavitation bubbles and quantify the created flow disturbance. We demonstrate rapid (in the millisecond timescale) and efficient micromixing (up to 98%) within a length scale of only 200 µm and over a flow rate ranging from 5 to 40 µL/min.",

However, it is currently unknown whether miRNA-independent functions of DGCR8 play any role in the maintenance of neuronal progenitors and during corticogenesis. Here, by phenotypic comparison of cortices from conditional Dgcr8 and Dicer knockout mice, we show that Dgcr8 deletion, in contrast to Dicer depletion, leads to premature differentiation of neural progenitor cells and overproduction of TBR1-positive neurons. Remarkably, depletion of miRNAs upon DCGR8 loss is reduced compared to DICER loss, indicating that these phenotypic differences are mediated by miRNA-independent functions of DGCR8. We show that Dgcr8 mutations induce an earlier and stronger phenotype in the developing nervous system compared to Dicer mutants and that miRNA-independent functions of DGCR8 are critical for corticogenesis. Finally, our data also suggest that the Microprocessor complex, with DROSHA and DGCR8 as core components, directly regulates the Tbr1 transcript, containing evolutionarily conserved hairpins that resemble miRNA precursors, independently of miRNAs.",

            "abstract": "© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2017. Perovskites have been demonstrated in solar cells with a power conversion efficiency of well above 20%, which makes them one of the strongest contenders for next generation photovoltaics. While there are no concerns about their efficiency, very little is known about their stability under illumination and load. Ionic defects and their migration in the perovskite crystal lattice are some of the most alarming sources of degradation, which can potentially prevent the commercialization of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). In this work, we provide direct evidence of electric field-induced ionic defect migration and we isolate their effect on the long-term performance of state-of-the-art devices. Supported by modelling, we demonstrate that ionic defects, migrating on timescales significantly longer (above 103 s) than what has so far been explored (from 10-1 to 102 s), abate the initial efficiency by 10-15% after several hours of operation at the maximum power point. Though these losses are not negligible, we prove that the initial efficiency is fully recovered when leaving the device in the dark for a comparable amount of time. We verified this behaviour over several cycles resembling day/night phases, thus probing the stability of PSCs under native working conditions. This unusual behaviour reveals that research and industrial standards currently in use to assess the performance and the stability of solar cells need to be adjusted for PSCs. Our work paves the way for much needed new testing protocols and figures of merit specifically designed for PSCs.",

            "abstract": "© 2017 Elsevier Ltd The CM chondrites represent the largest group of hydrated meteorites and span a wide range of conditions, from less altered (i.e., CM2) down to heavily altered (i.e., CM1). The Paris chondrite is considered the least altered CM and thus enables the earliest stages of aqueous alteration processes to be deciphered. Here, we report results from a nanoscale study of tochilinite/cronstedtite intergrowths (TCIs) in Paris—TCIs being the emblematic secondary mineral assemblages of CM chondrites, formed from the alteration of Fe-Ni metal beads (type-I TCIs) and anhydrous silicates (type-II TCIs). We combined high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, scanning transmission X-ray microscopy and electron diffraction tomography to characterize the crystal structure, crystal chemistry and redox state of TCIs. The data obtained are useful to reconstruct the alteration conditions of Paris and to compare them with those of other meteorites. Our results show that tochilinite in Paris is characterized by a high hydroxide layer content (n = 2.1–2.2) regardless of the silicate precursors. When examined alongside other CMs, it appears that the hydroxide layer and iron contents of tochilinites correlate with the degree of alteration experienced by the chondrites. The Fe3+/ΣFe ratios of TCIs are high: 8–15% in tochilinite, 33–60% in cronstedtite and 70–80% in hydroxides. These observations suggest that alteration of CM chondrites took place under oxidizing conditions that could have been induced by significant H2 release during serpentinization. Similar results were recently reported in CR chondrites (Le Guillou et al., 2015), suggesting that the process(es) controlling the redox state of the secondary mineral assemblages were quite similar in the CM and CR parent bodies despite the different alteration conditions. According to our mineralogical and crystallographic survey, the formation of TCIs in Paris occurred at temperatures lower than 100 °C, under neutral, slightly alkaline conditions that favored the formation of both tochilinite and cronstedtite. During the course of alteration, the reduction in sulfur activity and/or the decrease of temperature prevented tochilinite crystallization and favoured the formation of cronstedtite and iron hydroxides. We suggest that iron hydroxides probably formed as ferrihydrite and then progressively converted to goethite between 50° and 80 °C, a temperature range that is also favorable for cronstedtite formation. The presence of cronstedtite plays a key role in the reconstruction of the alteration history, demonstrating that the alteration of Paris took place by way of serpentinization processes similar to those described on the Earth.",

In this work, we demonstrate that a proper functionalization of the recycled paper with two successive polymer treatments, imposes a mineral oil migration barrier and simultaneously renders it waterproof and grease resistant, making it an ideal material for food contact. The first poly (methyl methacrylate) treatment penetrates the paper network and creates a protective layer around every fiber, permitting thus the transformation of the paperboard to a hydrophobic material throughout its thickness, reducing at the same time the mineral oil migration. Subsequently, the second layer with a cyclic olefin copolymer fills the open pores of the surface, and reduces the mineral oil hydrocarbons migration at levels below those proposed by the BMEL. Online liquid chromatography-gas chromatography coupled with flame ionization detection quantitatively demonstrate that this dual functional treatment prevents the migration of both saturated (mineral oil saturated hydrocarbons) and aromatic hydrocarbon (mineral oil aromatic hydrocarbons) mineral oils from the recycled paperboard to a dry food simulant.",

            "abstract": "© 2017 the authors. MicroRNAs (miRNA) play an important role in post-transcriptional gene regulation of several physiological and pathological processes. In multiple sclerosis (MS), a chronic inflammatory and degenerative disease of the CNS, and in its mouse model, the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), miRNA dysregulation has been mainly related to immune system dysfunction and white matter (WM) pathology. However, little is known about their role in gray matter pathology. Here, we explored miRNA involvement in the inflammation-driven alterations of synaptic structure and function, collectively known as synaptopathy, a neuropathological process contributing to excitotoxic neurodegeneration in MS/EAE. Particularly, we observed that miR-142-3p is increased in the CSF of patients with active MS and in EAE brains. We propose miR-142-3p as a molecular mediator of the IL-1β-dependent downregulation of the glial glutamate-aspartate transporter (GLAST), which causes an enhancement of the glutamatergic transmission in the EAE cerebellum. The synaptic abnormalities mediated by IL-1β and the clinical and neuropathological manifestations of EAE disappeared in miR-142 knockout mice. Furthermore, we observed that in vivo miR-142-3p inhibition, either by a preventive and local treatment or by a therapeutic and systemic strategy, abolished IL-1β - and GLAST-dependent synaptopathy in EAE wild-type mice. Consistently, miR-142-3p was responsible for the glutamatergic synaptic alterations caused by CSF of patients with MS, and CSF levels of miR-142-3p correlated with prospective MS disease progression. Our findings highlight miR-142-3p as key molecular player in IL-1β -mediated synaptic dysfunction, possibly leading to excitotoxic damage in both EAE and MS diseases. Inhibition of miR-142-3p could be neuroprotective in MS.",

As these two events occur early during neurodegenerative process, they could be considered ideal therapeutic targets. Areas covered: This review describes the nanotechnologies explored for the specific targeted delivery of drugs, in order to precisely direct molecules into the intended site, where they can practice their therapeutic effects. Expert opinion: Conventional drug delivery systems cannot provide adequate restoration and connection patterns that are essential for a functional recovery in NDs. Since orally delivered antioxidants are easily destroyed by acids and enzymes, only a small portion of consumed antioxidants gets absorbed, leading to low bioavailability and low concentration at the target site. In this scenario, the identification of new proenergetic drugs, in combination with the development of methods for selectively delivering biologically active molecules into mitochondria, will potentially launch new therapeutic approaches for the treatment of NDs, where energetic imbalance plays a central role.",

The proposed controller uses a time-delay estimation technique to estimate and cancel nonlinear terms in robot dynamics including disturbance torques due to the joint flexibility, and assigns desired dynamics specified by a sliding variable. A gain-adaptation law is developed to dynamically update the gain of the proposed controller using the magnitude of the sliding variable and the gain itself. The gain-adaptation law uses a leakage term to prevent overestimation of the gain value, and offers stable and chattering-free control action. The effectiveness of the proposed adaptive controller is experimentally verified on a humanoid robot equipped with flexible joints. Tracking performances of the autotuned adaptive gain are better than those of the manually tuned constant gains. The proposed control algorithm is model-free, adaptive, robust, and highly accurate.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.In the sensors field the active sensing material frequently needs a controlled temperature in order to work properly. In microsystems technology, micro-machined hotplates represent a platform consisting of a thin suspended membrane where the sensing material can be deposited, usually integrating electrical stimuli and temperature readout. The micro-hotplate ensures a series of advantages such as miniaturized size, fast response, high sensitivity, low power consumption and selectivity for chemical sensing. This work compares the coplanar and the buried approach for the micro-hotplate heaters design with the aim to optimize the fabrication process and to propose a guideline for the choice of the suitable design with respect to the applications. In particular, robust Finite Element Method (FEM) models are set up in order to predict the electrical and thermal behavior of the micro-hotplates. The multiphysics approach used for the simulation allows to match as close as possible the actual device to the predictive model: geometries, materials, physics have been carefully linked to the fabricated devices to obtain the best possible accuracy. The materials involved in the fabrication process are accurately selected in order to improve the yield of the process and the performance of the devices. The fabricated micro-hotplates are able to warm the active region up to 400 ºC (with a corresponding power consumption equal to 250 mW @ 400 ºC) with a uniform temperature distribution in the buried micro-hotplate and a controlled temperature gradient in the coplanar one. A response time of about 70 ms was obtained on the virtual model, which perfectly agrees with the one measured on the fabricated device. Besides morphological, electrical and thermal characterizations, this work includes reliability tests in static and dynamic modes.",

We have previously identified 2-phenoxy-1,4-naphthoquinone as an inhibitor of both Trypanosoma brucei and human GAPDH. Herein, through multiple chemical, biochemical, and biological studies, and through the design of analogs, we confirmed the formation of a covalent adduct, we clarified the inhibition mechanism, and we demonstrated antitrypanosomal, antiplasmodial, and cytotoxic activities in cell cultures. The overall results lent support to the hypothesis that 2-phenoxy-1,4-naphthoquinone binds the GAPDH catalytic cysteine covalently through a phenolate displacement mechanism. By investigating the reactivity of 2-phenoxy-1,4-naphthoquinone and its analogs with four GAPDH homologs, we showed that the covalent inhibition is not preceded by the formation of a strong non-covalent complex. However, an up to fivefold difference in inactivation rates among homologs hinted at structural or electrostatic differences of their active sites that could be exploited to further design kinetically selective inhibitors. Moreover, we preliminarily showed that 2-phenoxy-1,4-naphthoquinone displays selectivity for GAPDHs over two other cysteine-dependent enzymes, supporting its suitability as a warhead starting fragment for the design of novel inhibitors.",

Mobility restrictions of the PMMA chains in the porous samples with pore size below 200 nm was consistently demonstrated with several experimental techniques, including differential scanning calorimetry, Raman spectroscopy, and broadband dielectric spectroscopy.

Molecu- lar imprinting is a potential strategy to target polymer nanoparticles through binding of endogenous ligands that may promote recognition and active transport into specific cells and tissues. However, the lock-and-key mechanism of molecular imprinting requires relatively rigid cross-linked structures, unlike those of many biodegradable polymers. To date, no fully biodegradable molecularly imprinted particles have been reported in the literature. This paper reports the synthesis of a novel molecularly- imprinted nanocarrier, based on poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) and acrylic acid, that combines biodegradability and molec- ular recognition properties. A novel three-arm biodegradable cross-linker was synthesized by ring-opening polymerization of glycolide and lactide initiated by glycerol. The resulting macromer was functionalized by introduction of end-functions through reaction with acryloyl chloride. Macromer and acrylic acid were used for the synthesis of narrowly-dispersed nanoparticles by radical polymerization in diluted conditions in the presence of biotin as template molecule. The binding capacity of the imprinted nanoparticles towards biotin and biotinylated bovine serum albumin was twentyfold that of non-imprinted nanoparti- cles. Degradation rates and functional performances were assessed in in vitro tests and cell cultures, demonstrating effective biotin-mediated cell internalization.",

Five types of GRM were used: one type of graphite nanoplatelets, two different grades of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and the same rGO grades after thermal annealing for 1 h at 1700 °C under vacuum to reduce their defectiveness. Polymerization of CBT into pCBT, morphology and nanoparticle organization were investigated by means of differential scanning calorimetry, electron microscopy and rheology. Electrical and thermal properties were investigated by means of volumetric resistivity and bulk thermal conductivity measurement. In particular, the reduction of nanoflake aspect ratio during ring-opening polymerization was found to have a detrimental effect on both electrical and thermal conductivities in nanocomposites.",

A novel lesion-mask free method based on a gamma mixture model was applied to myelin water fraction (MWF) maps to estimate the association between cortical thickness and myelin content, and how it differs between relapsing-remitting (RRMS) and secondary-progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) groups (135 and 23 patients, respectively). It was compared to an approach based on lesion masks. The gamma mixture distribution of whole brain, white matter (WM) MWF was characterized with three variables: the mode (most frequent value) m1 of the gamma component shown to relate to lesion, the mode m2 of the component shown to be associated with normal appearing (NA) WM, and the mixing ratio (λ) between the two distributions. The lesion-mask approach relied on the mean MWF within lesion and within NAWM. A multivariate regression analysis was carried out to find the best predictors of cortical thickness for each group and for each approach. The gamma-mixture method was shown to outperform the lesion-mask approach in terms of adjusted R2, both for the RRMS and SPMS groups. The predictors of the final gamma-mixture models were found to be m1 (β = 1.56, p &lt; 0.005), λ (β = -0.30, p &lt; 0.0005) and age (β = -0.0031, p &lt; 0.005) for the RRMS group (adjusted R2 = 0.16), and m2 (β = 4.72, p &lt; 0.0005) for the SPMS group (adjusted R2 = 0.45). Further, a DICE coefficient analysis demonstrated that the lesion mask had more overlap to an ROI associated with m1, than to an ROI associated with m2 (p &lt; 0.00001), and vice versa for the NAWM mask (p &lt; 0.00001). These results suggest that during the relapsing phase, focal WM damage is associated with cortical thinning, yet in SPMS patients, global WM deterioration has a much stronger influence on secondary degeneration. Through these findings, we demonstrate the potential contribution of myelin loss on neuronal degeneration at different disease stages and the usefulness of our statistical reduction technique which is not affected by the typical bias associated with approaches based on lesion masks.",

KGaA, Weinheim A multimode coherent hybrid system formed by strongly coupled surface plasmons in gold nanohole arrays and excitons in sulforhodamine 101 dyes is investigated by using both a steady-state spectroscopic method and a femtosecond transient absorption spectra approach. A double Rabi splitting up to 255 meV and 188 meV is observed in steady-state transmission measurements. Furthermore, the dynamics of the multimode coherent hybrid system are studied under upper band resonant excitation. It is found that the bleaching signal associated with uncoupled sulforhodamine 101 molecules completely disappears. Instead, two distinctive bleaching signals corresponding to the middle and lower bands are formed, thus highlighting the presence of coherent hybrid states. Finally, a remarkebly long lifetime for the lower band is observed, even longer than the bleaching recovery of the uncoupled dyes, in perfect agreement with the non-Markovian regime. These peculiar features can provide new perspectives for coherent energy transfer and mode-selective chemistry, thus enriching the tools available in the chemical reaction landscape.",

We present a multibody simulator being used for compliant humanoid robot modelling and report our reasoning for choosing the settings of the simulator’s key features. First, we provide a study on how the numerical integration speed and accuracy depend on the coordinate representation of the multibody system. This choice is particularly critical for mechanisms with long serial chains (e.g. legs and arms). Our second contribution is a full electromechanical model of the inner dynamics of the compliant actuators embedded in the COMAN robot, since joints’ compliance is needed for the robot safety and energy efficiency. Third, we discuss the different approaches for modelling contacts and selecting an appropriate contact library. The recommended solution is to couple our simulator with an open-source contact library offering both accurate and fast contact modelling. The simulator performances are assessed by two different tasks involving contacts: a bimanual manipulation task and a squatting tasks. The former shows reliability of the simulator. For the latter, we report a comparison between the robot behaviour as predicted by our simulation environment, and the real one.",

The fusion of multi-sensors such as an inertial measurement unit and foot pressure sensors are considered, which can be regarded as human's vestibular and proprioception. We define a set of feature-based fall indicator variables (FIVs) with manually extracted thresholds for four major disturbance scenarios, which are incorporated with an online threshold interpolation technique to manage generic disturbances. Indeed, a general falling is predicted by using a normalized value of the instantaneous and cumulative sum of each FIVs compared to a predefined set-value of the falling indication. The proposed method is evaluated by numerical experiments under 36 different scenarios, involving random disturbances applied at distinct heights. The results depict that the developed method is generic in terms of handling disturbances as well as different configurations of the robot and the use of fused FIVs performs better than that of a single FIV; in particular, the fusion with the foot pressure sensor based indicator increases the overall performance of the prediction.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 The Authors. Hepatology published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc., on behalf of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases. The ST18 gene has been proposed to act either as a tumor suppressor or as an oncogene in different human cancers, but direct evidence for its role in tumorigenesis has been lacking thus far. Here, we demonstrate that ST18 is critical for tumor progression and maintenance in a mouse model of liver cancer, based on oncogenic transformation and adoptive transfer of primary precursor cells (hepatoblasts). ST18 messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein were detectable neither in normal liver nor in cultured hepatoblasts, but were readily expressed after subcutaneous engraftment and tumor growth. ST18 expression in liver cells was induced by inflammatory cues, including acute or chronic inflammation in vivo, as well as coculture with macrophages in vitro. Knocking down the ST18 mRNA in transplanted hepatoblasts delayed tumor progression. Induction of ST18 knockdown in pre-established tumors caused rapid tumor involution associated with pervasive morphological changes, proliferative arrest, and apoptosis in tumor cells, as well as depletion of tumor-associated macrophages, vascular ectasia, and hemorrhage. Reciprocally, systemic depletion of macrophages in recipient animals had very similar phenotypic consequences, impairing either tumor development or maintenance, and suppressing ST18 expression in hepatoblasts. Finally, RNA sequencing of ST18-depleted tumors before involution revealed down-regulation of inflammatory response genes, pointing to the suppression of nuclear factor kappa B–dependent transcription. Conclusion: ST18 expression in epithelial cells is induced by tumor-associated macrophages, contributing to the reciprocal feed-forward loop between both cell types in liver tumorigenesis. Our findings warrant the exploration of means to interfere with ST18-dependent epithelium–macrophage interactions in a therapeutic setting. (Hepatology 2017;65:1708-1719).",

In this combined computational-experimental study, we analyze the structure, organization, and dynamics of functionalized coating thiols in monolayer-protected gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). We explain how functionalized coating thiols self-organize through a delicate and somehow counterintuitive balance of interactions within the monolayer itself and with the solvent. We further describe how the nature and plasticity of these interactions modulate nanoparticle-based chemosensing. Importantly, we found that self-organization of coating thiols can induce the formation of binding pockets in AuNPs. These transient cavities can accommodate small molecules, mimicking protein-ligand recognition, which could explain the selectivity and sensitivity observed for different organic analytes in NMR chemosensing experiments. Thus, our findings advocate for the rational design of tailored coating groups to form specific recognition binding sites on monolayer-protected AuNPs.",

            "abstract": "© 2017 the authors. Gephyrin is a key scaffold protein mediating the anchoring of GABAA receptors at inhibitory synapses. Here, we exploited superresolution techniques combined with proximity-based clustering analysis and model simulations to investigate the single-molecule gephyrin reorganization during plasticity of inhibitory synapses in mouse hippocampal cultured neurons. This approach revealed that, during the expression of inhibitory LTP, the increase of gephyrin density at postsynaptic sites is associated with the promoted formation of gephyrin nanodomains. We demonstrate that the gephyrin rearrangement in nanodomains stabilizes the amplitude of postsynaptic currents, indicating that, in addition to the number of synaptic GABAA receptors, the nanoscale distribution of GABAA receptors in the postsynaptic area is a crucial determinant for the expression of inhibitory synaptic plasticity. In addition, the methodology implemented here clears the way to the application of the graph-based theory to single-molecule data for the description and quantification of the spatial organization of the synapse at the single-molecule level.",

Two dimensional (2D) colloidal PbS nanoplatelets (NPLs) with a thickness of 1.8-2.8 nm have been synthesized using a single-molecule precursor approach with lead octadecylxanthate.

Transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction reveal that the NPLs have an orthorhombic crystal structure rather than the rocksalt phase usually reported for bulk and nanostructured PbS. The 1.8 nm thickness, in combination with the tunable lateral dimensions, results in a blue-shifted absorption peak at 715-730 nm and a 48-68 nm narrow emission spectrum with a surprisingly small, 18 nm Stokes shift at room temperature. The fluorescence lifetime of these PbS NPLs is 2 orders of magnitude shorter than the typical lifetime in 0D colloidal PbS quantum dots, highlighting the advantageous properties of colloidal 2D nanostructures that combine strong transversal with weak lateral confinement.",

We have developed a colloidal synthesis of nearly monodisperse nanocrystals of pure Cs4PbX6 (X = Cl, Br, I) and their mixed halide compositions with sizes ranging from 9 to 37 nm. The optical absorption spectra of these nanocrystals display a sharp, high energy peak due to transitions between states localized in individual PbX6 4- octahedra. These spectral features are insensitive to the size of the particles and in agreement with the features of the corresponding bulk materials. Samples with mixed halide composition exhibit absorption bands that are intermediate in spectral position between those of the pure halide compounds. Furthermore, the absorption bands of intermediate compositions broaden due to the different possible combinations of halide coordination around the Pb2+ ions. Both observations are supportive of the fact that the [PbX6]4- octahedra are electronically decoupled in these systems. Because of the large band gap of Cs4PbX6 (&gt;3.2 eV), no excitonic emission in the visible range was observed. The Cs4PbBr6 nanocrystals can be converted into green fluorescent CsPbBr3 nanocrystals by their reaction with an excess of PbBr2 with preservation of size and size distributions. The insertion of PbX2 into Cs4PbX6 provides a means of accessing CsPbX3 nanocrystals in a wide variety of sizes, shapes, and compositions, an important aspect for the development of precisely tuned perovskite nanocrystal inks.",

Nowadays, an increasing number of components are manufactured using Hot Isostatic Pressing (HIP), which is considered a near net or net shape forming technology, depending on the overstock thickness. One of the most challenging tasks with regard to improving HIP is limiting the interaction between the capsule and the consolidating powders, aiming to reduce material waste and costs. The capsule is typically made of mild carbon steel and it is used to correctly transfer the forming pressure to the loose powders at the HIP temperature. The great inhomogeneity between the two materials at such a high pressure and temperature lead to a strong elemental diffusion between the powders and the capsule, which leads to the formation of an interface. This study investigates in depth, the effects of this diffusion during the consolidation of Astroloy powders.",

Cognitive control can be differentiated into several cognitive sub-processes pivotal in GD clinical phenomenology, such as response inhibition, conflict monitoring, decision-making, and cognitive flexibility. This article aims to systematically review fMRI studies, which investigated the neural mechanisms underlying diminished cognitive control in GD. We conducted a comprehensive literature search and collected neuropsychological and neuroimaging data investigating cognitive control in GD. We included a total of 14 studies comprising 499 individuals. Our results indicate that impaired activity in prefrontal cortex may account for decreased cognitive control in GD, contributing to the progressive loss of control over gambling urges. Among prefrontal regions, orbital and ventromedial areas seem to be a possible nexus for sensory integration, value-based decision-making and emotional processing, thus contributing to both motivational and affective aspects of cognitive control. Finally, we discussed possible therapeutic approaches aimed at the restoration of cognitive control in GD, including pharmacological and brain stimulation treatments.",

Neural responses in striatal, limbic and somatosensory brain regions track individual differences in loss aversion, i.e. the higher sensitivity to potential losses compared with equivalent gains in decision-making under risk. The engagement of structures involved in the processing of aversive stimuli and experiences raises a further question, i.e. whether the tendency to avoid losses rather than acquire gains represents a transient fearful overreaction elicited by choice-related information, or rather a stable component of one's own preference function, reflecting a specific pattern of neural activity. We tested the latter hypothesis by assessing in 57 healthy human subjects whether the relationship between behavioral and neural loss aversion holds at rest, i.e. when the BOLD signal is collected during 5 minutes of cross-fixation in the absence of an explicit task. Within the resting-state networks highlighted by a spatial group Independent Component Analysis (gICA), we found a significant correlation between strength of activity and behavioral loss aversion in the left ventral striatum and right posterior insula/supramarginal gyrus, i.e. the very same regions displaying a pattern of neural loss aversion during explicit choices. Cross-study analyses confirmed that this correlation holds when voxels identified by gICA are used as regions of interest in task-related activity and vice versa. These results suggest that the individual degree of (neural) loss aversion represents a stable dimension of decision-making, which reflects in specific metrics of intrinsic brain activity at rest possibly modulating cortical excitability at choice.",

ECT has been also shown to be effective in schizophrenia (SZ), particularly when rapid symptom reduction is needed or in cases of resistance to drug-treatment. However, its precise mechanisms of action remain largely unknown. Objective/Hypothesis This study examined whether ECT exerts disorder-specific or unspecific modulation of brain structure and function in SZ and MDD. Methods We investigated neuromodulatory effects of right-sided unilateral ECT in pharmacoresistant patients with SZ or MDD. Magnetic resonance imaging was conducted before and after ECT to investigate treatment-related effects on brain structure and function. Imaging data were analyzed by means of Voxel Based Morphometry and Resting State Functional Connectivity (RSFC) methods. Results Right unilateral ECT induced transdiagnostic regional increases of limbic gray matter and modulations of neural coupling at rest. Structural effects were accompanied by a decrease in RSFC within temporoparietal, prefrontal and cortical midline structures, and an increase in hypothalamic RSFC. The extent of structural and functional change was partially inversely associated with the baseline measures. Conclusion The present findings provide first evidence for transdiagnostic changes of brain structure together with modulation of brain function after ECT. The data indicate diagnosis-unspecific mechanisms of action with respect to regional gray matter volume and resting-state functional connectivity.",

            "abstract": "© Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014. Trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) is a member of TAAR family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). The members of this class of receptors discovered in 2001 have been found in some tissues ranging from the central nervous system to the olfactory epithelium and in some peripheral organs. The best studied receptor, TAAR1, is activated by a class of compounds named trace amines (TAs) that include compounds such as β-phenylethylamine (PEA), p-tyramine, octopamine, and tryptamine normally present at low levels in the mammalian brain. Although TA levels have been associated with many neuropsychiatric disorders, only the discovery of TAAR1 validated their physiological role. TAAR1 can modulate monoamine neurotransmission and, in particular, dopamine systems. Several studies have demonstrated that TAAR1 knockout (TAAR1-KO) mice display a supersensitive dopaminergic system, while activation of TAAR1 can reduce dopaminergic hyperactivity obtained either with pharmacological tools or present in genetic mouse model. For these reasons, TAAR1 has been proposed as a novel therapeutic target for neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and addiction. Moreover, several peripheral functions of TAAR1 have been described recently indicating intriguing novel TAAR1 roles in system physiology. Here we will review brain and peripheral functions mediated by TAAR1 and other TAARs.",

Recently, Hb has been found synthesized in atypical sites, including the brain.

Here we show that Hb confers DA cells' susceptibility to 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP +) and rotenone, neurochemical cellular models of PD. The toxic property of Hb does not depend on O2 binding and is associated with insoluble aggregate formation in the nucleolus. Neurochemical stress induces epigenetic modifications, nucleolar alterations and autophagy inhibition that depend on Hb expression. When adeno-associated viruses carrying α-and β-chains of Hb are stereotaxically injected into mouse SN, Hb forms aggregates and causes motor learning impairment.

            "abstract": "© 2017. Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd. Extracellular pH impacts on neuronal activity, which is in turn an important determinant of extracellular H+ concentration. The aim of this study was to describe the spatio-temporal dynamics of extracellular pH at synaptic sites during neuronal hyperexcitability. To address this issue we created ex.E2GFP, a membrane-targeted extracellular ratiometric pH indicator that is exquisitely sensitive to acidic shifts. By monitoring ex.E2GFP fluorescence in real time in primary cortical neurons, we were able to quantify pH fluctuations during network hyperexcitability induced by convulsant drugs or highfrequency electrical stimulation. Sustained hyperactivity caused a pH decrease that was reversible upon silencing of neuronal activity and located at active synapses. This acidic shift was not attributable to the outflow of synaptic vesicle H+ into the cleft nor to the activity of membrane-exposed H+ V-ATPase, but rather to the activity of the Na+/H+-exchanger. Our data demonstrate that extracellular synaptic pH shifts take place during epileptic-like activity of neural cultures, emphasizing the strict links existing between synaptic activity and synaptic pH. This evidence may contribute to the understanding of the physio-pathological mechanisms associated with hyperexcitability in the epileptic brain.",

Ischemic damage to the brain triggers substantial reorganization of spared areas and pathways, which is associated with limited, spontaneous restoration of function. A better understanding of this plastic remodeling is crucial to develop more effective strategies for stroke rehabilitation. In this review article, we discuss advances in the comprehension of post-stroke network reorganization in patients and animal models. We first focus on rodent studies that have shed light on the mechanisms underlying neuronal remodeling in the perilesional area and contralesional hemisphere after motor cortex infarcts. Analysis of electrophysiological data has demonstrated brain-wide alterations in functional connectivity in both hemispheres, well beyond the infarcted area. We then illustrate the potential use of non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques to boost recovery. We finally discuss rehabilitative protocols based on robotic devices as a tool to promote endogenous plasticity and functional restoration.",

It is thus crucial to assess the damage caused to such materials by cosmic rays and neutrons, which pose a variety of hazards through atomic displacements following neutron-nucleus collisions. Here we report the first study of the neutron radiation tolerance of two poly(thiophene)s-based organic semiconductors: poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl), P3HT, and the liquid-crystalline poly(2,5-bis (3-tetradecylthiophen-2-yl)thieno[3,2-b]thiophene), PBTTT. We combine spectroscopic investigations with characterisation of intrinsic charge mobility to show that PBTTT exhibits significantly higher tolerance than P3HT. We explain this in terms of a superior chemical, structural and conformational stability of PBTTT, which can be ascribed to its higher crystallinity, in turn induced by a combination of molecular design features. Our approach can be used to develop design strategies for better neutron radiation-tolerant materials, thus paving the way for organic semiconductors to enter avionics and space applications.",

Fundamental relevant properties, such as thermal and electrochemical stability, density, and ionic conductivity were analyzed to evaluate the effects caused by the presence of the ether bond in the side chain and/or in the organic cation ring. Upon lithium salt addition, two electrolytes suitable for lithium batteries applications were found. Higher conducting properties of the piperidinium-based electrolyte resulted in enhanced cycling performances when tested with LiFePO4 (LFP) cathode in lithium cells. When mixing the P1,2O2TFSI/LiTFSI electrolyte with a tailored alkyl carbonate mixture, the cycling performance of both Li and Li-ion cells greatly improved, with prolonged cyclability delivering very stable capacity values, as high as the theoretical one in the case of Li/LFP cell configurations.",

Herein we report on the effect of the process parameters on the morphology and physical properties of LIG nanostructures. We show that the scan speed and the frequency of the incident radiation affect the gas evolution, inducing different structure rearrangements, an interesting nitrogen self-doping phenomenon and consequently different conduction properties. The materials were characterized by infrared and Raman spectroscopy, XPS elemental analysis, electron microscopy and electrical/electrochemical measurements. In particular the samples were tested as interdigitated electrodes into electrochemical supercapacitors and the optimized LIG arrangement was tested in parallel and series supercapacitor configurations to allow power exploitation.",

We have developed a mathematical model able to predict the dependence of the current density, j0, in the dc limit, on the thickness of a photoactive semiconductor layer, d, in contact with an electrolyte. The model considers the application of an external bias. The theoretical analysis has been done by means of a diffusive model, where the excess of charges moves by diffusion in the presence of a generation term, due to the incident light, and a recombination term, proportional to the excess of charge carriers. We show that a non-monotonic dependence of j0 vs. d is expected. For small d, the photocurrent density is proportional to d and the proportionality constant is related to both the attenuation of the light in the photoactive semiconductor layer and to the applied potential. In the opposite limit of large d, the current tends to a constant value that is dependent on both the light intensity and the applied bias. Our theoretical predictions are in qualitative agreement with the experimental data reported in literature for BiVO4 films.",

A clear and significant time-dependent accumulation in tumor tissue is shown in in vivo photo-acoustic studies on a murine melanoma xenograft model. The proposed O/W nano-emulsion exhibits also high values of r2/r1 (ranging from 45 to 85, depending on the magnetic field) suggesting a possible use as T2 weighted image contrast agents. In addition, viability and cellular uptake studies show no significant cytotoxicity on the fibroblast cell line.

The localized insitu formation of tin dioxide (SnO2) nanoparticles embedded in poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) films is presented. This is achieved by the photoinduced conversion of the tin acetate precursor included in polymeric films, through controlled UV or visible pulsed laser irradiation at λ=355 and 532nm, respectively. The evolution of the formation of nanoparticles is followed by UV/Vis spectroscopy and shows that their growth is affected in different ways by the laser pulses at the two applied wavelengths. This, in combination with electron microscopy analysis, reveals that, depending on the irradiation wavelength, the size of the nanoparticles in the final nanocomposites differs. This difference is attributed to distinct mechanistic pathways that lead to the synthesis of small nanoparticles (from 1.5 to 4.5nm) at λ=355nm, whereas bigger ones (from 5 to 16nm) are formed at λ=532nm. At the same time, structural studies with both X-ray and electron diffraction measurements demonstrate the crystallinity of SnO2 nanoparticles in both cases, whereas XPS analysis confirms the light-induced oxidation of tin acetate into SnO2. Taken all together, it is demonstrated that the pulsed laser irradiation at λ=355 and 532nm leads to the formation of SnO2 nanoparticles with defined features highly dispersed in PMMA solid matrices.",

A long-term plan is created based on a probabilistic task representation, learned by demonstration, and an estimate of the human occupancy to be avoided. Using an additional overapproximative, short-term prediction of human motion we guarantee that the robot can always account for sudden or reflex movements. We demonstrate our two-level obstacle avoidance in simulation.

            "abstract": "© 2017 Folli, Leonetti and Ruocco. Recurrent neural networks (RNN) have traditionally been of great interest for their capacity to store memories. In past years, several works have been devoted to determine the maximum storage capacity of RNN, especially for the case of the Hopfield network, the most popular kind of RNN. Analyzing the thermodynamic limit of the statistical properties of the Hamiltonian corresponding to the Hopfield neural network, it has been shown in the literature that the retrieval errors diverge when the number of stored memory patterns (P) exceeds a fraction (≈ 14%) of the network size N. In this paper, we study the storage performance of a generalized Hopfield model, where the diagonal elements of the connection matrix are allowed to be different from zero. We investigate this model at finite N. We give an analytical expression for the number of retrieval errors and show that, by increasing the number of stored patterns over a certain threshold, the errors start to decrease and reach values below unit for P ≫ N. We demonstrate that the strongest trade-off between efficiency and effectiveness relies on the number of patterns (P) that are stored in the network by appropriately fixing the connection weights. When P≫N and the diagonal elements of the adjacency matrix are not forced to be zero, the optimal storage capacity is obtained with a number of stored memories much larger than previously reported. This theory paves the way to the design of RNN with high storage capacity and able to retrieve the desired pattern without distortions.",

Previous works have considered the same physical problem and provided a complete analysis/synthesis for the problem of determining the shortest paths. The main difference in the two cost functions (length vs. time) lays on the rotation on the spot. Indeed, this maneuver has zero cost in terms of length and hence leads to a 2D shortest path synthesis. On the other hand, in case of minimum time, the synthesis depends also on the orientations of the vehicle. In other words, the not zero cost of the rotation on the spot maneuvers leads to a 3D minimum-time synthesis. Moreover, the shortest paths have been obtained by exploiting the geometric properties of the extremal arcs, i.e., straight lines, rotations on the spot, logarithmic spirals and involute of circles. Conversely, in terms of time, even if the extremal arcs of the minimum-time control problem are exactly the same, the geometric properties of these arcs change, leading to a completely different analysis and characterization of optimal paths. In this paper, after proving the existence of optimal trajectories and showing the extremal arcs of the problem at hand, we provide the control laws that steer the vehicle along these arcs and the time-cost along each of them. Moreover, this being a crucial step toward numerical implementation, optimal trajectories are proved to be characterized by a finite number of switching points between different extremal arcs, i.e., the concatenations of extremal arcs with infinitely many junction times are shown to violate the optimality conditions.",

            "abstract": "© 2017 CARS Purpose: We present the evaluation of the reproducibility of measurements performed using robotic ultrasound imaging in comparison with expert-operated sonography. Robotic imaging for interventional procedures may be a valuable contribution, but requires reproducibility for its acceptance in clinical routine. We study this by comparing repeated measurements based on robotic and expert-operated ultrasound imaging. Methods: Robotic ultrasound acquisition is performed in three steps under user guidance: First, the patient is observed using a 3D camera on the robot end effector, and the user selects the region of interest. This allows for automatic planning of the robot trajectory. Next, the robot executes a sweeping motion following the planned trajectory, during which the ultrasound images and tracking data are recorded. As the robot is compliant, deviations from the path are possible, for instance due to patient motion. Finally, the ultrasound slices are compounded to create a volume. Repeated acquisitions can be performed automatically by comparing the previous and current patient surface. Results: After repeated image acquisitions, the measurements based on acquisitions performed by the robotic system and expert are compared. Within our case series, the expert measured the anterior–posterior, longitudinal, transversal lengths of both of the left and right thyroid lobes on each of the 4 healthy volunteers 3 times, providing 72 measurements. Subsequently, the same procedure was performed using the robotic system resulting in a cumulative total of 144 clinically relevant measurements. Our results clearly indicated that robotic ultrasound enables more repeatable measurements. Conclusions: A robotic ultrasound platform leads to more reproducible data, which is of crucial importance for planning and executing interventions.",

However, in addition to this behavior, haptic stimuli were proven to convey also affective inputs to the brain. Nevertheless, such affective properties of touch are often disregarded in the design (and consequent validation) of haptic displays. In this paper we present some preliminary experimental evidences about how emotional feelings, intrinsically present while interacting with tactile displays, can be assessed. We propose a methodology based on a bidimensional model of elicited emotions evaluated by means of simple psychometric tests and statistical inference. Specifically, affective dimensions are expressed in terms of arousal and valence, which are quantified through two simple one-question psychometric tests, whereas statistical inference is based on rank-based non-parametric tests. In this work we consider two types of haptic systems: (i) a softness display, FYD-2, which was designed to convey purely discriminative softness haptic stimuli and (ii) a system designed to convey affective caress-like stimuli (by regulating the velocity and the strength of the “caress”) on the user forearm. Gender differences were also considered. In both devices, the affective component clearly depends on the stimuli and it is gender-related. Finally, we discuss how such outcomes might be profitably used to guide the design and the usage of haptic devices, in order to take into account also the emotional component, thus improving system performance.",

The aim of this review is to analyze and to summarize the state of the art of the processing of aluminum alloys, and in particular of the AlSi10Mg alloy, obtained by means of the Additive Manufacturing (AM) technique known as Selective Laser Melting (SLM). This process is gaining interest worldwide, thanks to the possibility of obtaining a freeform fabrication coupled with high mechanical properties related to a very fine microstructure. However, SLM is very complex, from a physical point of view, due to the interaction between a concentrated laser source and metallic powders, and to the extremely rapid melting and the subsequent fast solidification. The effects of the main process variables on the properties of the final parts are analyzed in this review: from the starting powder properties, such as shape and powder size distribution, to the main process parameters, such as laser power and speed, layer thickness, and scanning strategy. Furthermore, a detailed overview on the microstructure of the AlSi10Mg material, with the related tensile and fatigue properties of the final SLM parts, in some cases after different heat treatments, is presented.",

During mixed infections or cancer, macrophages are often exposed to both cytokines, but how these two programs influence each other remains unclear. We found that IFN-γ and IL-4 mutually inhibited the epigenomic and transcriptional changes induced by each cytokine alone. Computational and functional analyses revealed the genomic bases for gene-specific cross-repression. For instance, while binding motifs for the transcription factors STAT1 and IRF1 were associated with robust and IL-4-resistant responses to IFN-γ, their coexistence with binding sites for auxiliary transcription factors such as AP-1 generated vulnerability to IL-4-mediated inhibition. These data provide a core mechanistic framework for the integration of signals that control macrophage activation in complex environmental conditions.",

We observe a high trapping efficiency due to plasmon-enhanced optical trapping of the gold component. Furthermore, we develop an accurate model of optical trapping of this hybrid system in the T-matrix framework studying how the plasmon-enhanced optical forces scale with gold nanoparticle number in the mesocapsule. The relevance of effective optical trapping in hollow plasmonic mesocapsules is twofold for detection and delivery technologies: positioning and activation processes.

UV-nanoimprint lithography is employed for the preparation of the arrays of nanopillars from photo-crosslinked N-isopropylacrylamide (pNIPAAm)-based hydrogel that are covalently tethered to a gold surface. The thermo-responsive properties of such pNIPAAm nanopillars that swell in 3D are compared to those of a thin film prepared from the identical material and that is allowed to swell predominantly in 1D. The nanopillars with a diameter of ≈100 nm and aspect ratio of 2 swell by a factor of ≈6 as determined by optical measurements supported by simulations that are compared to morphological characteristics obtained from atomic force microscopy. Bending of nanopillars above the lower critical solution temperature (LCST), erasure of the topographic structure by drying at temperature below the LCST, and recovery by subsequent swelling below the LCST and drying at temperature above the LCST are observed.

            "abstract": "© 2017, Springer International Publishing AG. Controlling complex robotic platforms is a challenging task, especially in designs with high levels of kinematic redundancy. Novel variable stiffness actuators (VSAs) have recently demonstrated the possibility of achieving energetically more efficient and safer behaviour by allowing the ability to simultaneously modulate the output torque and stiffness while adding further levels of actuation redundancy. An optimal control approach has been demonstrated as an effective method for such a complex actuation mechanism in order to devise a control strategy that simultaneously provides optimal control commands and time-varying stiffness profiles. However, traditional optimal control formulations have typically focused on optimisation of the tasks over a predetermined time horizon with smooth, continuous plant dynamics. In this chapter, we address the optimal control problem of robotic systems with VSAs for the challenging domain of switching dynamics and discontinuous state transition arising from interactions with an environment. First, we present a systematic methodology to simultaneously optimise control commands, time-varying stiffness profiles as well as the optimal switching instances and total movement duration based on a time-based switching hybrid dynamics formulation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the control of a brachiating robot with a VSA considering multi-phase swing-up and locomotion tasks as an illustrative application of our proposed method in order to exploit the benefits of the VSA and intrinsic dynamics of the system. Then, to address the issue of model discrepancies in model-based optimal control, we extend the proposed framework by incorporating an adaptive learning algorithm. This performs continuous data-driven adjustments to the dynamics model while re-planning optimal policies that reflect this adaptation. We show that this augmented approach is able to handle a range of model discrepancies in both simulations and hardware experiments.",

This is promising, but the nanostructured alumina should be fabricated from inexpensive raw material. We fabricated porous alumina from commercial aluminum food plate in 0.4 M aqueous phosphoric acid, aiming to design an effective manufacturing protocol for the material used as nanoporous filler in dental restorative composites, an application demonstrated previously by our group. We identified the critical input parameters of anodization voltage, bath temperature and anodization time, and the main output parameters of pore diameter, pore spacing and oxide thickness. Scanning electron microscopy and grain analysis allowed us to assess the nanostructured material, and the statistical design of experiments was used to optimize its fabrication. We analyzed a preliminary dataset, designed a second dataset aimed at clarifying the correlations between input and output parameters, and ran a confirmation dataset. Anodization conditions close to 125 V, 20 °C, and 7 h were identified as the best for obtaining, in the shortest possible time, pore diameters and spacing of 100-150 nm and 150-275 nm respectively, and thickness of 6-8 μm, which are desirable for the selected application according to previously published results. Our analysis confirmed the linear dependence of pore size on anodization voltage and of thickness on anodization time. The importance of proper control on the experiment was highlighted, since batch effects emerge when the experimental conditions are not exactly reproduced.",

VGLUT2-expressing cells were optically stimulated while local field potential and whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were performed in mouse entorhinal cortical slices perfused with the proconvulsive compound 4-aminopyridine (4-AP). In control conditions, blue light flashes directly depolarized the majority of putative glutamatergic cells, which in turn synaptically excited GABAergic interneurons. During bath perfusion with 4-AP, photostimuli triggered a fast EPSP-IPSP sequence which was often followed by tonic-clonic seizure-like activity closely resembling spontaneous ictal discharges. The GABA A -receptor antagonist gabazine blocked the progression of both light-induced and spontaneous seizures. Surprisingly, prolonged photostimuli delivered during ongoing seizures caused a robust interruption of synchronous discharges. Such break was correlated with a membrane potential depolarization block in principal cells, while putative GABAergic interneurons changed their firing activity from a burst-like to an irregular single-spike pattern. These data suggest that photostimulation of glutamatergic neurons triggers seizure-like activity only in the presence of an intact GABAergic transmission and that selectively activating the same glutamatergic cells robustly interrupts ongoing seizures by inducing a strong depolarization block, resulting in the disruption of paroxysmal burst-like firing.",

Specifically, solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance experiments showed that the nanoparticles, synthesized by reactive suspension method, can efficiently link the matrix by hydrogen bonds forming a hybrid organic-inorganic 3D network. Such evidences strongly supports our previously reported theory, in which the nanoparticles in situ synthesized by reactive suspension method act not only as rigid filler, but also as actual cross-linking points, dramatically improving the mechanical properties of the polymeric matrix. Moreover, as revealed by transmission electron microscopy investigations, the formation of such hydrogen bonds significantly affect also the nanoparticles distribution, thanks to a stabilizing effect on the nanoparticles’ surface that prevents their aggregation and improves their dispersion.",

            "abstract": "© 2017 Jilin UniversityThis paper focuses on the developments of a generic gait synthesis for the humanoid robot COMAN. Relying on the essential Gait Pattern Generator (GPG), the proposed synthesis offers enhanced versatilities for the locomotion under different purposes, and also provides the data storage and communication mechanisms among different modules. As an outcome, we are able to augment new abilities for COMAN by integrating new control modules and software tools at a cost of very few modifications. Moreover, foot placement optimization is introduced to the GPG to optimize the gait parameter references in order to meet the robot's natural dynamics and kinematics, which enhances the synthesis's robustness while it's being implemented on real robots. We have also presented a practical approach to generate pelvis motion from CoM references using a simplified three-point-mass model, as well as a straightforward but effective idea for the state estimation using the sensory feedback. Three physical experiments were studied in an increasing complexity to demonstrate the effectiveness and successful implementation of the proposed gait synthesis on a real humanoid system.",

            "abstract": "© 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature. High-risk and MYCN-amplified neuroblastomas are among the most aggressive pediatric tumors. Despite intense multimodality therapies, about 50% of these patients succumb to their disease, making the search for effective therapies an absolute priority. Due to the important functions of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerases, PARP inhibitors have entered the clinical settings for cancer treatment and are being exploited in a variety of preclinical studies and clinical trials. PARP inhibitors based combination schemes have also been tested in neuroblastoma preclinical models with encouraging results. However, the expression of PARP enzymes in human neuroblastoma and the biological consequences of their inhibition remained largely unexplored. Here, we show that high PARP1 and PARP2 expression is significantly associated with high-risk neuroblastoma cases and poor survival, highlighting its previously unrecognized prognostic value for human neuroblastoma. In vitro, PARP1 and 2 are abundant in MYCN amplified and MYCN-overexpressing cells. In this context, PARP inhibitors with high ‘PARP trapping’ potency, such as olaparib or talazoparib, yield DNA damage and cell death preceded by intense signs of replication stress. Notwithstanding the activation of a CHK1-CDC25A replication stress response, PARP-inhibited MYCN amplified and overexpressing cells fail to sustain a prolonged checkpoint and progress through mitosis in the presence of damaged DNA, eventually undergoing mitotic catastrophe. CHK1-targeted inhibition of the replication stress checkpoint exacerbated this phenotype. These data highlight a novel route for cell death induction by PARP inhibitors and support their introduction, together with CHK1 inhibitors, in therapeutic approaches for neuroblastomas with high MYC(N) activity.Oncogene advance online publication, 10 April 2017; doi:10.1038/onc.2017.40.",

Larval Drosophila offer a study case for behavioral neurogenetics that is simple enough to be experimentally tractable, yet complex enough to be worth the effort. We provide a detailed, hands-on manual for Pavlovian odor-reward learning in these animals. Given the versatility of Drosophila for genetic analyses, combined with the evolutionarily shared genetic heritage with humans, the paradigm has utility not only in behavioral neurogenetics and experimental psychology, but for translational biomedicine as well. Together with the upcoming total synaptic connectome of the Drosophila nervous systemand the possibilities of single-cell-specific transgene expression, it offers enticing opportunities for research. Indeed, the paradigmhas already been adopted by a number of labs and is robust enough to be used for teaching in classroom settings. This has given rise to a demand for a detailed, hands-on manual directed at newcomers and/or at laboratory novices, and this is what we here provide. The paradigm and the present manual have a unique set of features: • The paradigm is cheap, easy, and robust; • The manual is detailed enough for newcomers or laboratory novices; • It briefly covers the essential scientific context; • It includes sheets for scoring, data analysis, and display; • It is multilingual: in addition to an English version we provide German, French, Japanese, Spanish and Italian language versions as well. The present manual can thus foster science education at an earlier age and enable research by a broader community than has been the case to date.",

This study describes a new preparation method, which combines freeze drying and supercritical CO2 foaming approaches, for the preparation of drug delivery scaffolds of polycaprolactone loaded with 5-fluorouracil, an anti-cancer drug, with low solubility in scCO2. It is a principal objective of this work to design a scCO2 strategy to reduce 5-Fu solubility limitations in its homogeneous distribution into a PCL scaffold through the design of an innovative processing method. The design of this process is considered valuable for the development of clean technology in pharmacy and medicine, since most of the active agents have a null solubility in scCO2·Supercritical CO2 is used as a blowing agent to induce polymer foaming by means of the low temperature pressure quench process. The resulting samples have been prepared under different operational conditions focused on enhancing the performance of the release process. In this case, design of experiments (DOE) was considered for a more comprehensive and systematic optimization of the product. In particular, drug amount, equals to 4.8 or 9.1 wt%, process temperature, of 45 or 50 °C and depressurization rate, equals to 0.1 MPas− 1 or 2 MPas− 1 were selected as the factors to be investigated by a three-factor at two-level full factorial design. Samples were characterized to establish porosity data, drug loading percentage and, especially, release profile chromatographically monitored. Results from DOE have concluded which are the best samples providing a sustained drug release for several days, which may be of great interest to develop materials for tissue engineering and sustained release applications.",

Stealth agents are extensively investigated as a means by which to prolong nanostructure residence time in the bloodstream by avoiding uptake by the reticuloendothelial system. Unfortunately, commonly used agents such as poly(ethylene glycol) can adversely impact targeting efficiency and promote immune reaction by the host organism. Therefore, there is an increasing interest in developing biocompatible, non-PEGylated organic nanostructures able to perform targeted delivery to increase the efficacy of liposomal technology. Here, a lipopeptide is presented that can be mixed with lipids commonly used in liposomal formulations in percentages ranging from 20% to 60% w/w. The resulting vesicles are thermally and chemically stable. The peptide coating limits serum-protein adsorption even upon prolonged incubation in pure serum in physiological conditions, outperforming PEGylated liposomes. This architecture can be easily modified to allow straightforward derivatization by standard bio-orthogonal conjugation. Upon derivatization with an anti-transferrin receptor aptamer, these vesicles show highly selective cellular internalization with minimal nonspecific uptake and pH-triggered doxorubicin release.",

A growing body of evidence links deregulation of sphingolipids to several diseases, including cancer. Indeed, AC expression is abnormally high in melanoma cells. AC inhibition may thus be key to treating malignant melanoma. Here, we have used a systematic scaffold exploration to design a general pharmacophore for AC inhibition. This pharmacophore comprises a 6 + 5 fused ring heterocycle linked to an aliphatic substituent via a urea moiety. We have thus identified the novel benzimidazole derivatives 10, 21, 27, and 30, which are highly potent AC inhibitors. Their chemical and metabolic stabilities are comparable or superior to those of previously reported AC inhibitors. Moreover, they are potent against endogenous AC in intact melanoma cells. These novel inhibitors merit further characterization and can serve as a promising starting point for the discovery of new antimelanoma therapeutics.",

Photoinitiator-free fabrication of poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) scaffolds is achieved using a novel three-dimensional (3D) printing method called mask projected excimer laser stereolithography (MPExSL). The spatial resolution of photoinitiator-free curing is suitable for 3D layer-by-layer fabrication with a single layer thickness well controllable at tens to hundreds of microns using 248 nm wavelength for the irradiation. The photoinitiator-free scaffolds are superior compared to their counterparts fabricated by using photoinitiator molecules, showing a higher level of biocompatibility. A release of toxic chemicals from the photoinitiator containing scaffolds is proven by cell proliferation tests. In contrast, no toxic release is found from the photoinitiator-free scaffolds, resulting in the very same level of cell proliferation as the control sample. The demonstration of photoinitiator-free PEGDA scaffolds enables the fabrication of 3D scaffolds with the highest level of biocompatibility for both in vitro and in vivo applications.",

            "abstract": "© 2017 Elsevier B.V.Degenerately doped semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs) are of recent interest to the NC community due to their tunable localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs) in the near infrared (NIR). The high level of doping in such materials with carrier densities in the range of 1021cm−3 leads to degeneracy of the doping levels and intense plasmonic absorption in the NIR. The lower carrier density in degenerately doped semiconductor NCs compared to noble metals enables LSPR tuning over a wide spectral range, since even a minor change of the carrier density strongly affects the spectral position of the LSPR. Two classes of degenerate semiconductors are most relevant in this respect: impurity doped semiconductors, such as metal oxides, and vacancy doped semiconductors, such as copper chalcogenides. In the latter it is the density of copper vacancies that controls the carrier concentration, while in the former the introduction of impurity atoms adds carriers to the system. LSPR tuning in vacancy doped semiconductor NCs such as copper chalcogenides occurs by chemically controlling the copper vacancy density. This goes in hand with complex structural modifications of the copper chalcogenide crystal lattice. In contrast the LSPR of degenerately doped metal oxide NCs is modified by varying the doping concentration or by the choice of host and dopant atoms, but also through the addition of capacitive charge carriers to the conduction band of the metal oxide upon post-synthetic treatments, such as by electrochemical- or photodoping. The NIR LSPRs and the option of their spectral fine-tuning make accessible important new features, such as the controlled coupling of the LSPR to other physical signatures or the enhancement of optical signals in the NIR, sensing application by LSPR tracking, energy production from the NIR plasmon resonance or bio-medical applications in the biological window. In this review we highlight the recent advances in the synthesis of various different plasmonic semiconductor NCs with LSPRs covering the entire spectral range, from the mid- to the NIR. We focus on copper chalcogenide NCs and impurity doped metal oxide NCs as the most investigated alternatives to noble metals. We shed light on the structural changes upon LSPR tuning in vacancy doped copper chalcogenide NCs and deliver a picture for the fundamentally different mechanism of LSPR modification of impurity doped metal oxide NCs. We review on the peculiar optical properties of plasmonic degenerately doped NCs by highlighting the variety of different optical measurements and optical modeling approaches. These findings are merged in an exhaustive section on new and exciting applications based on the special characteristics that plasmonic semiconductor NCs bring along.",

It has been shown that individual acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients are characterized by one of few initiating DNA mutations and 5–10 cooperating mutations not yet defined among hundreds identified by massive sequencing of AML genomes. We report an in vivo insertional-mutagenesis screen for genes cooperating with one AML initiating mutations (PML-RARA, oncogene of acute promyelocytic leukemia, APL), which allowed identification of hundreds of genetic cooperators. The cooperators are mutated at low frequency in APL or AML patients but are always abnormally expressed in a cohort of 182 APLs and AMLs analyzed. These deregulations appear non-randomly distributed and present in all samples, regardless of their associated genomic mutations. Reverse-engineering approaches showed that these cooperators belong to a single transcriptional gene network, enriched in genes mutated in AMLs, where perturbation of single genes modifies expression of others. Their gene-ontology analysis showed enrichment of genes directly involved in cell proliferation control. Therefore, the pool of PML-RARA cooperating mutations appears large and heterogeneous, but functionally equivalent and deregulated in the majority of APLs and AMLs. Our data suggest that the high heterogeneity of DNA mutations in APLs and AMLs can be reduced to patterns of gene expression deregulation of a single ‘mutated’ gene network.Leukemia advance online publication, 20 January 2017; doi:10.1038/leu.2016.386.",

By studying the polarization state of the Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering it is, in particular, possible to better understand the re-radiation effects in linear nanoantennas featuring spectrally distinct localized plasmon resonances (LSPR). Here we show that, through the selective excitation of the short- or the long- axis LSPR, it is possible to control and totally rotate (90°) the polarization of the SERS photons of randomly oriented molecules adsorbed on linear nanoantennas. By a proper design of the nanoantenna, this can be accomplished switching the excitation wavelength from the visible to the NIR, while using orthogonal fields polarizations, so to match the two distinct LSPRs. Modeling the nanoantenna enhancement with wavelength-dependent field enhancement tensors we recover the relations ruling the parallel-polarized and unpolarized- SERS intensity dependence found experimentally when selectively driving the two LSPRs. Our results support a physical picture in which the strongly coupled molecule-nanoantenna system behaves as an hybrid structure whose energy levels are determined by the molecule while the far-field radiation properties are determined by the antenna modes.",

Electrophysiology and calcium imaging experiments demonstrate that physiological functions of live cells are fully preserved in the presence of P3HT-NPs. From a complementary point of view, the photophysical properties of P3HT-NPs are also mainly maintained within the cellular environment, as proven by in situ time-resolved photoluminescence. Interestingly, we detect slight modifications in emission spectra and dynamics, which we ascribe to the contribution from the P3HT-NPs surface, possibly due to conformational changes as the result of the interaction with intracellular proteins or the formation of NPs aggregates. This work demonstrates that P3HT-NPs are excellent candidates for use as light sensitive actuators, due to their remarkable physical properties, optimal biocompatibility and capability of interaction with living cells.",

Aim: With the purpose of delivering high doses of glabrescione B (GlaB) to solid tumors after systemic administration, long-circulating GlaB-loaded oil-cored polymeric nanocapsules (NC-GlaB) were formulated. Materials &amp; methods: Synthesis of GlaB and its encapsulation in nanocapsules (NCs) was performed. Empty and GlaB-loaded NCs were assessed for their physico-chemical properties, in vitro cytotoxicity and in vivo biodistribution. Results: GlaB was efficiently loaded into NCs (90%), which were small (160 nm), homogeneous and stable upon storage. Further, GlaB and NC-GlaB demonstrated specific activities against the cancer stem cells. Preliminary studies in tumor-bearing mice supported the ability of NC to accumulate in pancreatic tumors. Conclusion: This study provides early evidence that NC-GlaB has the potential to be utilized in a preclinical setting and justifies the need to perform therapeutic experiments in mice.",

            "abstract": "© 2017 Bentham Science Publishers. Background: The brain is the most protected organ in the human body; its protective shield, relying on a complex system of cells, proteins and transporters, prevents potentially harmful substances from entering the brain from the bloodstream but, on the other hand, it also stops drugs administered via the systemic route. To improve the efficacy of pharmacological treatments, targeted drug delivery by means of polymer nanoparticles is a challenging but, at the same time, efficient strategy. Methods: Thanks to a highly multidisciplinary approach, several ways to overcome the brain protection have provided effective solutions to treat a large number of diseases. Important advances in polymer science, together with the development of novel techniques for nanocarrier preparation, and the discovery of novel targeting ligands and molecules, allow a fine-tuning of size, shape, chemicophysical properties and surface chemistry of functional particulate systems; it enables the improvement of the therapeutic performances for several drugs, also toward districts that are difficult to be treated, such as the brain. Conclusion: This review focuses on the great strides made from scientists and doctors in the development of polymer nano-sized drug delivery systems for brain diseases. Even though the optimal nanocarrier was not yet discovered, important advances were made to strive for safer, performant and successful systems, with the expectation to find soon better solutions to cure some still untreatable pathologies.",

            "abstract": "© 2017 Elsevier Ltd Porous pillared graphene oxide (GO) materials were prepared using solvothermal reaction of Hummers GO with solution of Tetrakis(4-aminophenyl)methane (TKAm) in methanol. The intercalation of TKAm molecules between individual GO sheets, performed under swelling condition, results in expansion of inter-layer distance of GO from ∼7.5 Å to 13-14 Å. Pillaring GO with bulky, rigid 3D shaped TKAm molecules could be an advantage for the preparation of stable pillared structures compared to e.g. aliphatic or aromatic diamines. Insertion of TKAm molecules into inter-layer space of GO results in formation of interconnected network of sub-nanometer slit pores. The expanded GO structure prepared with optimized GO/TKAm composition shows Specific Surface Area (SSA) up to 660 m2/g which is among the highest reported for GO materials pillared using organic spacers. Modelling of GO structures pillared with TKAm molecules shows that maximal SSA of about 2300 m2/g is theoretically possible for realistic concentration of pillaring molecules in GO interlayers. Hydrogen sorption by pillared GO/TKAm is found to follow standard correlation with SSA both at ambient and liquid nitrogen temperatures with highest uptakes of 1.66 wt% achieved at 77 K and 0.25 wt% at 295 K. Our theoretical simulations show that pillared GO structures do not provide improvement of hydrogen storage beyond well-established physisorption trends even for idealized materials with subnanometer pores and SSA of 2300–3700 m2/g.",

The as-obtained materials were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction analysis, N2 adsorption at-196 °C, and highresolution transmission electron microscopy. The results of these analyses showed that the nanocomposites consisted of a dispersion of metallic Fe nanoparticles within a porous ceramic matrix, mainly based on amorphous silica and alumina. These nanocomposites were magnetically characterized, and their magnetic response was studied. Finally, the obtained metal-ceramic nanocomposite materials were used in the separation of Escherichia coli DNA from a crude cell lysate.

Background A set of engineered ferritin mutants from Archaeoglobus fulgidus (Af-Ft) and Pyrococcus furiosus (Pf-Ft) bearing cysteine thiols in selected topological positions inside or outside the ferritin shell have been obtained. The two apo-proteins were taken as model systems for ferritin internal cavity accessibility in that Af-Ft is characterized by the presence of a 45 Å wide aperture on the protein surface whereas Pf-Ft displays canonical (threefold) channels. Methods Thiol reactivity has been probed in kinetic experiments in order to assess the protein matrix permeation properties towards the bulky thiol reactive DTNB (5,5′-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid) molecule. Results Reaction of DTNB with thiols was observed in all ferritin mutants, including those bearing free cysteine thiols inside the ferritin cavity. As expected, a ferritin mutant from Pf-Ft, in which the cysteine thiol is on the outer surface displays the fastest binding kinetics. In turn, also the Pf-Ft mutant in which the cysteine thiol is placed within the internal cavity, is still capable of full stoichiometric DTNB binding albeit with an almost 200-fold slower rate. The behaviour of Af-Ft bearing a cysteine thiol in a topologically equivalent position in the internal cavity was intermediate among the two Pf-Ft mutants. Conclusions and general significance The data thus obtained indicate clearly that the protein matrix in archaea ferritins does not provide a significant barrier against bulky, negatively charged ligands such as DTNB, a finding of relevance in view of the multiple biotechnological applications of these ferritins that envisage ligand encapsulation within the internal cavity.",

Previous work in our group identified serine-derived β-lactams as potent and systemically active inhibitors of NAAA activity. Aiming to expand the SAR study around this class of compounds, we investigated the effect of the substitution on the endocyclic nitrogen by designing and synthesizing a series of N-substituted β-lactams. The present work describes the synthesis of new N-O-alkyl and N-O-aryl substituted β-lactams and reports the results of the structure activity relationship (SAR) study leading to the discovery of a novel, single-digit nanomolar NAAA inhibitor (37). Compound 37 was shown in vitro to inhibit human NAAA via S-acylation of the catalytic cysteine, and to display very good selectivity vs. human Acid Ceramidase, a cysteine amidase structurally related to NAAA. Preliminary in vivo studies showed that compound 37, administered topically, reduced paw edema and heat hyperalgesia in a carrageenan-induced inflammation mouse model. The high in vitro potency of 37 as NAAA inhibitor, and its encouraging in vivo activity qualify this compound as a new tool for the study of the role of NAAA in inflammatory and pain states.",

            "abstract": "© The Royal Society of Chemistry. In the last three decades, protein and nucleic acid structure determination and comprehension of the mechanisms, leading to their physiological and pathological functions, have become a cornerstone of biomedical sciences. A deep understanding of the principles governing the fates of cells and tissue at the molecular level has been gained over the years, offering a solid basis for the rational design of drugs aimed at the pharmacological treatment of numerous diseases. Historically, affinity indicators (i.e. Kd and IC50/EC50) have been assumed to be valid indicators of the in vivo efficacy of a drug. However, recent studies pointed out that the kinetics of the drug-receptor binding process could be as important or even more important than affinity in determining the drug efficacy. This eventually led to a growing interest in the characterisation and prediction of the rate constants of protein-ligand association and dissociation. For instance, a drug with a longer residence time can kinetically select a given receptor over another, even if the affinity for both receptors is comparable, thus increasing its therapeutic index. Therefore, understanding the molecular features underlying binding and unbinding processes is of central interest towards the rational control of drug binding kinetics. In this review, we report the theoretical framework behind protein-ligand association and highlight the latest advances in the experimental and computational approaches exploited to investigate the binding kinetics.",

            "abstract": "© 2017 American Chemical Society. Transition metals are both essential micronutrients and limited in environmental availability. The Ni(II)-dependent urease protein, the most efficient enzyme known to date, is a paradigm for studying the strategies that cells use to handle an essential, yet toxic, metal ion. Urease is a virulence factor of several human pathogens, in addition to decreasing the efficiency of soil organic nitrogen fertilization. Ni(II) insertion in the urease active site is performed through the action of three essential accessory proteins: UreD, UreF, and UreG. The crystal structure of the UreD-UreF-UreG complex from the human pathogen Helicobacter pylori (HpUreDFG) revealed the presence of tunnels that cross the entire length of both UreF and UreD, potentially able to deliver Ni(II) ions from UreG to apo-urease. Atomistic molecular dynamics simulations performed on the HpUreDFG complex in explicit solvent and at physiological ionic conditions demonstrate the stability of these protein tunnels in solution and provide insights on the trafficking of water molecules inside the tunnels. The presence of different alternative routes across the identified tunnels for Ni(II) ions, water molecules, and carbonate ions, all involved in urease activation, is highlighted here, and their potential role in the urease activation mechanism is discussed.",

Cold atoms in an optical lattice with brick-wall geometry have been used to mimic graphene, a two-dimensional material with characteristic Dirac excitations. Here we propose to bring such artificial graphene into the proximity of a second atomic layer with a square lattice geometry. For non-interacting fermions, we find that such bilayer system undergoes a phase transition from a graphene-like semi-metal phase, characterized by a band structure with Dirac points, to a gapped band insulator phase. In the presence of attractive interactions between fermions with pseudospin-1/2 degree of freedom, a competition between semi-metal and superfluid behavior is found at the mean-field level. Using the quantum Monte Carlo method, we also investigate the case of strong repulsive interactions. In the Mott phase, each layer exhibits a different amount of long-range magnetic order. Upon coupling both layers, a valence-bond crystal is formed at a critical coupling strength. Finally, we discuss how these bilayer systems could be realized in existing cold atom experiments.",

            "abstract": "© The Author(s) 2017. The combination of single particle detection and ultrafast laser pulses is an instrumental method to track dynamics at the femtosecond time scale in single molecules, quantum dots and plasmonic nanoparticles. Optimal control of the extremely short-lived coherences of these individual systems has so far remained elusive, yet its successful implementation would enable arbitrary external manipulation of otherwise inaccessible nanoscale dynamics. In ensemble measurements, such control is often achieved by resorting to a closed-loop optimization strategy, where the spectral phase of a broadband laser field is iteratively optimized. This scheme needs long measurement times and strong signals to converge to the optimal solution. This requirement is in conflict with the nature of single emitters whose signals are weak and unstable. Here we demonstrate an effective closed-loop optimization strategy capable of addressing single quantum dots at room temperature, using as feedback observable the two-photon photoluminescence induced by a phase-controlled broadband femtosecond laser. Crucial to the optimization loop is the use of a deterministic and robust-against-noise search algorithm converging to the theoretically predicted solution in a reduced amount of steps, even when operating at the few-photon level. Full optimization of the single dot luminescence is obtained within ∼100 trials, with a typical integration time of 100 ms per trial. These times are faster than the typical photobleaching times in single molecules at room temperature. Our results show the suitability of the novel approach to perform closed-loop optimizations on single molecules, thus extending the available experimental toolbox to the active control of nanoscale coherences.",

In this Perspective, we discuss the interplay of electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom in defining such an effect in realistic methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) models. We distinguish between bulk and surface effects and find that, while a spatially local (in time and space) effect may be at work in the bulk, a \"static\" band-splitting effect is found at surfaces due to structural distortion. The proposed surface effect is consistent with the low surface recombination reported for MAPbI3 single crystals and might contribute to the success of organohalide perovskites.",

The transferrin receptor (TfR) is a promising target in cancer therapy owing to its overexpression in most solid tumors and on the blood-brain barrier. Nanostructures chemically derivatized with transferrin are employed in TfR targeting but often lose their functionality upon injection in the bloodstream. As an alternative strategy, we rationally designed a peptide coating able to bind transferrin on suitable pockets not involved in binding to TfR or iron by using an iterative multiscale-modeling approach coupled with quantitative structure-activity and relationship (QSAR) analysis and evolutionary algorithms. We tested that selected sequences have low aspecific protein adsorption and high binding energy toward transferrin, and one of them is efficiently internalized in cells with a transferrin-dependent pathway. Furthermore, it promotes transferrin-mediated endocytosis of gold nanoparticles by modifying their protein corona and promoting oriented adsorption of transferrin. This strategy leads to highly effective nanostructures, potentially useful in diagnostic and therapeutic applications, which exploit (and do not suffer) the protein solvation for achieving a better targeting.",

            "abstract": "© 2017 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland. Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting, which is a type of artificial photosynthesis, is a sustainable way of converting solar energy into chemical energy. The water oxidation half-reaction has always represented the bottleneck of this process because of the thermodynamic and kinetic challenges that are involved. Several materials have been explored and studied to address the issues pertaining to solar water oxidation. Significant advances have recently been made in the use of stable and relatively cheap metal oxides, i.e., semiconducting photocatalysts. The use of BiVO4 for this purpose can be considered advantageous because this catalyst is able to absorb a substantial portion of the solar spectrum and has favourable conduction and valence band edge positions. However, BiVO4 is also associated with poor electron mobility and slow water oxidation kinetics and these are the problems that are currently being investigated in the ongoing research in this field. This review focuses on the most recent advances in the best-performing BiVO4-based photoanodes to date. It summarizes the critical parameters that contribute to the performance of these photoanodes, and highlights so far unresolved critical features related to the scale-up of a BiVO4-based PEC water-splitting device.",

Introduction: curcumin is the main bioactive component contained in Curcuma Longa, largely employed in traditional medicine. Recently, beneficial properties, useful for prevention and treatment of several disorders, have been discovered for this compound. Peculiar structural feature is an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl system essential for establishing contacts with critical cysteine residues of several targets. This distinctive mechanism of action imparts to the molecule the ability to affect a large number of targets, accounting for its pleiotropic behaviour and definition of “privileged structure”. Areas covered: The objective of the review is an examination of the recent developments in the field of the anti-cancer applications of curcumin, together with formulation issues, considering the patent literature in the years 2012-2016. Expert opinion: The wide therapeutic efficacy of curcumin is related to synergistic interactions with several biological targets, along with the modulation of several signaling pathways. This peculiar behaviour could be useful in the treatment of multifactorial diseases such as cancer. Combination of curcumin with a first line antineoplastic drug proved to be a valuable strategy to obtain an amplified response with minimized side effects. Innovative curcumin formulations based on the nanotechnology approach allowed improving both bioavailability and therapeutic efficacy.",

High resolution scanning Hall probe microscopy has been used to directly visualise the superconducting vortex behavior in hybrid structures consisting of a square array of micrometer-sized Py ferromagnetic disks covered by a superconducting Nb thin film. At remanence the disks exist in almost fully flux-closed magnetic vortex states, but the observed cloverleaf-like stray fields indicate the presence of weak in-plane anisotropy. Micromagnetic simulations suggest that the most likely origin is an unintentional shape anisotropy. We have studied the pinning of added free superconducting vortices as a function of the magnetisation state of the disks, and identified a range of different phenomena arising from competing energy contributions. We have also observed clear differences in the pinning landscape when the superconductor and the ferromagnet are electron ically coupled or insulated by a thin dielectric layer, with an indication of non-trivial vortex-vortex interactions. We demonstrate a complete reconfiguration of the vortex pinning potential when the magnetisation of the disks evolves from the vortex-like state to an onion-like one under an in-plane magnetic field. Our results are in good qualitative agreement with theoretical predictions and could form the basis of novel superconducting devices based on reconfigurable vortex pinning sites.",

            "abstract": "This paper presents a new algorithm for optimal control (OC) of nonlinear dynamical systems. The main feature of this algorithm is that it allows the specification of the control objectives as a hierarchy of tasks, each task representing an action that the robot should perform. Each task is described by a cost function that the algorithm tries to minimize, while not affecting the tasks of higher priority. The concept of strict priority allows for an easier and more robust specification of the control objectives, without hand tuning of task weights. The hierarchy also makes it possible to properly regularize the behavior of each task independently. For the first time, we properly define the problem of regularizing the task cost functions in the presence of a hierarchy and propose an algorithm to compute an approximate solution. Several simulated scenarios with different robots compare our solution with other state-of-the-art methods, validating the interest of the hierarchy in OC and empirically demonstrating the importance of regularization to generate feasible behaviors.",

The odorant receptor genes, seven transmembrane receptor genes constituting the vastest mammalian gene multifamily, are expressed monogenically and monoallelicaly in each sensory neuron in the olfactory epithelium. This characteristic, often referred to as the one neuron-one receptor rule, is driven by mostly uncharacterized molecular dynamics, generally named odorant receptor gene choice. Much attention has been paid by the scientific community to the identification of sequences regulating the expression of odorant receptor genes within their loci, where related genes are usually arranged in genomic clusters. A number of studies identified transcription factor binding sites on odorant receptor promoter sequences. Similar binding sites were also found on a number of enhancers that regulate in cis their transcription, but have been proposed to form interchromosomal networks. Odorant receptor gene choice seems to occur via the local removal of strongly repressive epigenetic markings, put in place during the maturation of the sensory neuron on each odorant receptor locus. Here we review the fast-changing state of art for the study of regulatory features for odorant receptor genes.",

In several instances, however, such measurement is unfeasible through conventional techniques, e.g., frequency response in linear viscoelasticity or measure of first normal stress difference. This difficulty is often found for very dilute macromolecular solutions. The case of polyelectrolyte solutions is especially important for their relevance in several bioengineering problems: Even theoretical predictions for this case can often not be tested in the absence of an experimental characterization. In this work, we succeed in measuring the relaxation time of two dilute/semidilute polyelectrolyte solutions as a function of added salt concentration. The relaxation time is measured through a novel microrheometrical technique based on the viscoelasticity-induced alignment of particles suspended in a microfluidic channel. We apply such technique to characterize two polyelectrolyte solutions, namely, hyaluronic acid and chitosan solutions. Relaxation times as small as 60 μs are detected, which are otherwise unmeasurable when using both conventional or other μ-rheometrical techniques.",

            "abstract": "© 2017 Author(s). In stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy, the role of the STED beam is to de-excite, via stimulated emission, the fluorophores that have been previously excited by the excitation beam. This condition, together with specific beam intensity distributions, allows obtaining true sub-diffraction spatial resolution images. However, if the STED beam has a non-negligible probability to excite the fluorophores, a strong fluorescent background signal (anti-Stokes emission) reduces the effective resolution. For STED scanning microscopy, different synchronous detection methods have been proposed to remove this anti-Stokes emission background and recover the resolution. However, every method works only for a specific STED microscopy implementation. Here we present a user-friendly synchronous detection method compatible with any STED scanning microscope. It exploits a data acquisition (DAQ) card based on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA), which is progressively used in STED microscopy. In essence, the FPGA-based DAQ card synchronizes the fluorescent signal registration, the beam deflection, and the excitation beam interruption, providing a fully automatic pixel-by-pixel synchronous detection method. We validate the proposed method in both continuous wave and pulsed STED microscope systems.",

Preclinical studies have demonstrated that repeated exposure to AMPH can induce damage to nerve terminals of dopamine (DA) neurons. We here assessed the underlying neurobiological changes in the DA system following repeated AMPH exposure and pre-treated rats with AMPH or saline (4 times 5 mg/kg s.c., 2 hours apart), followed by a 1-week washout period. We then used pharmacological MRI (phMRI) with a methylphenidate (MPH) challenge, as a sensitive and non-invasive invivo measure of DAergic function. We subsequently validated the DA-ergic changes postmortem, using a.o. high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and autoradiography. In the AMPH pre-treated group, we observed a significantly larger BOLD response to the MPH challenge, particularly in DA-ergic brain areas and their downstream projections. Subsequent autoradiography studies showed that AMPH pre-treatment significantly reduced DA transporter (DAT) density in the caudate-putamen (CPu) and nucleus accumbens, whereas HPLC analysis revealed increases in the DA metabolite homovanillic acid in the CPu. Our results suggest that AMPH pre-treatment alters DAergic responsivity, a change that can be detected with phMRI in rats. These phMRI changes likely reflect increased DA release together with reduced DAT binding. The ability to assess subtle synaptic changes using phMRI is promising for both preclinical studies of drug discovery, and for clinical studies where phMRI can be a useful tool to non-invasively investigate DA abnormalities, e.g. in neuropsychiatric disorders.",

A nonclathrin endocytic (NCE) pathway of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is activated at high ligand concentrations and targets receptors to degradation, attenuating signaling. Here we performed an unbiased molecular characterization of EGFR-NCE. We identified NCE-specific regulators, including the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident protein reticulon 3 (RTN3) and a specific cargo, CD147. RTN3 was critical for EGFR/CD147-NCE, promoting the creation of plasma membrane (PM)-ER contact sites that were required for the formation and/or maturation of NCE invaginations. Ca2+ release at these sites, triggered by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)-dependent activation of ER Ca2+ channels, was needed for the completion of EGFR internalization. Thus, we identified a mechanism of EGFR endocytosis that relies on ER-PM contact sites and local Ca2+ signaling.",

Background: Several neurodevelopmental disorders and brain injuries in children have been associated with proprioceptive dysfunction that will negatively affect their movement. Unfortunately, there is lack of reliable and objective clinical examination protocols and our current knowledge of how proprioception evolves in typically developing children is still sparse. Methods: Using a robotic exoskeleton, we investigated proprioceptive acuity of the wrist in a group of 49 typically developing healthy children (8-15 years), and a group of 40 young adults. Without vision participants performed an ipsilateral wrist joint position matching task that required them to reproduce (match) a previously experienced target position. All three joint degrees-of-freedom of the wrist/hand complex were assessed. Accuracy and precision were evaluated as a measure of proprioceptive acuity. The cross-sectional data indicating the time course of development of acuity were then fitted by four models in order to determine which function best describes developmental changes in proprioception across age. Results: First, the robot-aided assessment proved to be an easy to administer method for objectively measuring proprioceptive acuity in both children and adult populations. Second, proprioceptive acuity continued to develop throughout middle childhood and early adolescence, improving by more than 50% with respect to the youngest group. Adult levels of performance were reached approximately by the age of 12 years. An inverse-root function best described the development of proprioceptive acuity across the age groups. Third, wrist/forearm proprioception is anisotropic across the three DoFs with the Abduction/Adduction exhibiting a higher level of acuity than those of Flexion/extension and Pronation/Supination. This anisotropy did not change across development. Conclusions: Proprioceptive development for the wrist continues well into early adolescence. Our normative data obtained trough this novel robot-aided assessment method provide a basis against which proprioceptive function of pediatric population can be compared. This may aid the design of more effective sensorimotor intervention programs.",

The robotic device was compliant to the patient's movements and was able to modulate the level of assistance continuously throughout the trial (i.e., online adaptive modulation). Standard clinical and robotic evaluations of upper extremity motor performance were conducted before and after robotic training. There were improvements in upper extremity spasticity and motor functions. In addition, robotic training lead to positive changes in wrist active range of motion and kinematics: movements were smoother and there was a noticeable decrease in the level of robotic intervention required to complete each trial. In sum, results of the present case study demonstrate that distal upper extremity robotic rehabilitation that features the proposed adaptive control algorithm promoted positive changes in upper limb motor coordination and function after pediatric stroke.",

As a result of the treatment, cotton fabrics also demonstrated resistance to water penetration due to hydrostatic pressure build-up. The treatment is achieved by sequentially coating the fibers with a polymer nanocomposite comprising a C-6 perfluorinated acrylic copolymer and silica nanoparticles and acetoxy-cure silicone (PDMS) resin. Water droplets were easily repelled with corresponding roll-off angles well below 20°. Even impinging small droplets (8 µL) could be repelled with droplet roll-off angle of 17°. Additionally, treated fabrics were also able to hold a hydrostatic head pressure of 2.56 kPa (equal to 26 cm water column height) before leak. Performance of the hydrophobic cotton fabrics was tested by ultrasonic washing and wear abrasion tests. Hydrophobic fabrics resisted wear abrasion under 17.5 kPa up to 30 abrasion cycles. Moreover, the treatment was made in such a way that the open porous structured was preserved allowing breathability. The ease of application technique, industrial scale availability of the low-cost polymers and the non-toxic ingredients would allow this fabric treatment to be implemented in large scale textile treatment facilities.",

            "abstract": "© 2017 Springer Science+Business Media New York The role of dopamine D2 and D3 receptors (D2R/D3R), located on midbrain dopaminergic (DA) neurons, in the regulation of DA synthesis and release and in DA neuron homeostasis has been extensively investigated in rodent animal models. By contrast, the properties of D2R/D3R in human DA neurons have not been elucidated yet. On this line, the use of human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) for producing any types of cells has offered the innovative opportunity for investigating the human neuronal phenotypes at the molecular levels. In the present study, hiPSCs generated from human dermal fibroblasts were used to produce midbrain DA (mDA) neurons, expressing the proper set of genes and proteins typical of authentic, terminally differentiated DA neurons. In this model, the expression and the functional properties of the human D2R/D3R were investigated with a combination of biochemical and functional techniques. We observed that in hiPSC-derived mDA neurons, the activation of D2R/D3R promotes the proliferation of neuronal progenitor cells. In addition, we found that D2R/D3R activation inhibits nicotine-stimulated DA release and exerts neurotrophic effects on mDA neurons that likely occur via the activation of PI3K-dependent mechanisms. Furthermore, D2R/D3R stimulation counteracts both the aggregation of alpha-synuclein induced by glucose deprivation and the associated neuronal damage affecting both the soma and the dendrites of mDA neurons. Taken together, these data point to the D2R/D3R-related signaling events as a biochemical pathway crucial for supporting both neuronal development and survival and protection of human DA neurons.",

Study Objectives Sleep reduction after stroke is linked to poor recovery in patients. Conversely, a neuroprotective effect is observed in animals subjected to acute sleep deprivation (SD) before ischemia. This neuroprotection is associated with an increase of the sleep, melanin concentrating hormone (MCH) and orexin/hypocretin (OX) systems. This study aims to 1) assess the relationship between sleep and recovery; 2) test the association between MCH and OX systems with the pathological mechanisms of stroke. Methods Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned to four experimental groups: (i) SD-IS: SD performed before ischemia; (ii) IS: ischemia; (iii) SD-Sham: SD performed before sham surgery; (iv) Sham: sham surgery. EEG and EMG were recorded. The time-course of the MCH and OX gene expression was measured at 4, 12, 24 hours and 3, 4, 7 days following ischemic surgery by qRT-PCR. Results A reduction of infarct volume was observed in the SD-IS group, which correlated with an increase of REM sleep observed during the acute phase of stroke. Conversely, the IS group showed a reduction of REM sleep. Furthermore, ischemia induces an increase of MCH and OX systems during the acute phase of stroke, although, both systems were still increased for a long period of time only in the SD-IS group. Conclusions Our data indicates that REM sleep may be involved in the neuroprotective effect of SD preischemia, and that both MCH and OX systems were increased during the acute phase of stroke. Future studies should assess the role of REM sleep as a prognostic marker, and test MCH and OXA agonists as new treatment options in the acute phase of stroke.",

The Se substitution appears to suppress the local distortions within the BiS2 plane that may optimize in-plane orbital hybridization and hence the superconductivity.

It is caused by the inactivation of the galactocerebrosidase (GALC) enzyme that causes an increase in the cellular levels of psychosine considered to be at the origin of the tissue-level effects. GALC is inactivated also in the Twitcher (TWI) mouse: a genetic model of KD that is providing important insights into the understating of the pathogenetic process and the development of possible treatments. In this article an innovative optical technique, RP-CARS, is proposed as a tool to study the degree of order of the CH2 bonds inside the myelin sheaths of TWI-mice sciatic-nerve fibres. RP-CARS, a recently developed variation of CARS microscopy, is able to combine the intrinsic chemical selectivity of CARS microscopy with molecular-bond-spatial-orientation sensibility. This is the first time RP-CARS is applied to the study of a genetic model of a pathology, leading to the demonstration of a post-onset progressive spatial disorganization of the myelin CH2 bonds. The presented result could be of great interest for a deeper understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms underlying the human KD and, moreover, it is an additional proof of the experimental validity of this microscopy technique.

One clear case is saccadic suppression, the reduced visibility around the time of saccades, which is important in mediating visual stability; another is the oscillatory modulation of visibility synchronized with hand action. To suppress effectively the spurious retinal motion generated by the eye movements, it is crucial that saccadic suppression and saccadic onset be temporally synchronous. However, the mechanisms that determine this temporal synchrony are unknown. We investigated the effect of saccades on contrast discrimination sensitivity over a long period stretching over &gt;1 s before and after saccade execution. Human subjects made horizontal saccades at will to two stationary saccadic targets separated by 20°. At a random interval, a brief Gabor patch was displayed between the two fixations in either the upper or lower visual field and the subject had to detect its location. Strong saccadic suppression was measured between -50 and 50 ms from saccadic onset. However, the suppression was systematically embedded in a trough of oscillations of contrast sensitivity that fluctuated rhythmically in the delta range (at ∼3 Hz), commencing ∼1 s before saccade execution and lasting for up to 1 s after the saccade. The results show that saccadic preparation and visual sensitivity oscillations are coupled and the coupling might be instrumental in temporally aligning the initiation of the saccade with the visual suppression.",

Soft electrochemically-driven actuators based on high specific surface area electrodes and having a laminate structure similar to the electrical double-layer capacitors are attractive for future generations of biomimetic robotics. Successful incorporation of such ionic and capacitive actuators into soft robots demands highly repeatable and scalable fabrication techniques. As a novel approach in fabrication of ionic and capacitive laminates, the electroactive layers are deposited layer-by-layer around a woven fabric substrate, which is pertained as the centermost layer of the laminate. The electromechanical performance of the actuators having the textile reinforcement layer was on a par with similar actuators without the reinforcement layer; however, the reinforcement layer significantly simplifies the manufacturing process and increases repeatability of the actuators characteristics. More importantly, the reinforcement layer pertains its tensile strength, which gives new opportunities for incorporation of the soft ionic actuators directly onto fabric without compromising their excellent electromechanical performance. Fortunately, the same electroactive laminates, directly exposed to ambient air, have outstanding performance as electric double-layer capacitors for energy storage. Electromechanical characterization with a galvanostatic input was carried out on a large pool of actuators to identify the factors influencing the repeatability of their actuation. The new fabrication procedure yields electroactive laminates with outstanding uniformity in thickness and areal capacitance (standard deviations at 95% confidence interval are 9.2% and 9.4%, respectively) and with a lifetime of more than ten thousand cycles.",

            "abstract": "© 2017 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine. Nowadays there is a growing interest in particle therapy treatments exploiting light ion beams against tumors due to their enhanced relative biological effectiveness and high space selectivity. In particular promising results are obtained by the use of 4He projectiles. Unlike the treatments performed using protons, the beam ions can undergo a fragmentation process when interacting with the atomic nuclei in the patient body. In this paper the results of measurements performed at the Heidelberg Ion-Beam Therapy center are reported. For the first time the absolute fluxes and the energy spectra of the fragments - protons, deuterons, and tritons - produced by 4He ion beams of 102, 125 and 145 MeV u-1 energies on a poly-methyl methacrylate target were evaluated at different angles. The obtained results are particularly relevant in view of the necessary optimization and review of the treatment planning software being developed for clinical use of 4He beams in clinical routine and the relative bench-marking of Monte Carlo algorithm predictions.",

However, traditional light-sheet generation approaches based on elliptical or circular Gaussian beams suffer an inherent trade-off between light-sheet thickness and area over which this thickness is preserved. Recently, an increase in light-sheet uniformity was demonstrated using rapid biaxial Gaussian beam scanning along the lateral and beam propagation directions. Here we apply a similar scanning concept to an elliptical beam generated by a cylindrical lens. In this case, only z-scanning of the elliptical beam is required and hence experimental implementation of the setup can be simplified. We introduce a simple dimensionless uniformity statistic to better characterize scanned light-sheets and experimentally demonstrate custom tailored uniformities up to a factor of 5 higher than those of unscanned elliptical beams. This technique offers a straightforward way to generate and characterize a custom illumination profile that provides enhanced utilization of the detector dynamic range and field of view, opening the door to faster and more efficient 2D and 3D imaging.",

            "abstract": "© The Author(s) 2017. SHH Medulloblastoma (SHH-MB) is a pediatric brain tumor characterized by an inappropriate activation of the developmental Hedgehog (Hh) signaling. SHH-MB patients treated with the FDA-approved vismodegib, an Hh inhibitor that targets the transmembrane activator Smoothened (Smo), have shown the rapid development of drug resistance and tumor relapse due to novel Smo mutations. Moreover, a subset of patients did not respond to vismodegib because mutations were localized downstream of Smo. Thus, targeting downstream Hh components is now considered a preferable approach. We show here that selective inhibition of the downstream Hh effectors HDAC1 and HDAC2 robustly counteracts SHH-MB growth in mouse models. These two deacetylases are upregulated in tumor and their knockdown inhibits Hh signaling and decreases tumor growth. We demonstrate that mocetinostat (MGCD0103), a selective HDAC1/HDAC2 inhibitor, is a potent Hh inhibitor and that its effect is linked to Gli1 acetylation at K518. Of note, we demonstrate that administration of mocetinostat to mouse models of SHH-MB drastically reduces tumor growth, by reducing proliferation and increasing apoptosis of tumor cells and prolongs mouse survival rate. Collectively, these data demonstrate the preclinical efficacy of targeting the downstream HDAC1/2-Gli1 acetylation in the treatment of SHH-MB.",

            "abstract": "Self-similarity across length scales is pervasively observed in natural systems. Here, we investigate topological self-similarity in complex networks representing diverse forms of connectivity in the brain and some related dynamical systems, by considering the correlation between edges directly connecting any two nodes in a network and indirect connection between the same via all triangles spanning the rest of the network. We note that this aspect of self-similarity, which is distinct from hierarchically nested connectivity (coarse-grain similarity), is closely related to idempotence of the matrix representing the graph. We introduce two measures, t(1) and t(∞), which represent the element-wise correlation coefficients between the initial matrix and the ones obtained after squaring it once or infinitely many times, and term the matrices which yield large values of these parameters \"quasi-idempotent\". These measures delineate qualitatively different forms of \"shallow\" and \"deep\" quasi-idempotence, which are influenced by nodal strength heterogeneity. A high degree of quasi-idempotence was observed for partially synchronized mean-field Kuramoto oscillators with noise, electronic chaotic oscillators, and cultures of dissociated neurons, wherein the expression of quasi-idempotence correlated strongly with network maturity. Quasi-idempotence was also detected for macro-scale brain networks representing axonal connectivity, synchronization of slow activity fluctuations during idleness, and co-activation across experimental tasks, and preliminary data indicated that quasi-idempotence of structural connectivity may decrease with ageing. This initial study highlights that the form of network self-similarity indexed by quasi-idempotence is detectable in diverse dynamical systems, and draws attention to it as a possible basis for measures representing network \"collectivity\" and pattern formation.",

Because the band alignment, band bending and electronic noise are very sensitive to work function fluctuations, the dependence of the work function of nano-scale crystals on facet orientation can be a critical issue in optimizing optoelectronic devices based on these materials. We used scanning Kelvin probe microscopy to assess the local work function on samples of silver nano-plates at sub-micrometric spatial resolution. With the appropriate choice of the substrate and based on statistical analysis, it was possible to distinguish the surface potential of the different facets of silver nano-plates even if the measurements were done in ambient conditions without the use of vacuum. A phenomenological model was used to calculate the differences of facet work function of the silver nano-plates and the corresponding shift in Fermi level. This theoretical prediction and the experimentally observed difference in surface potential on the silver nano-plates were in good agreement. Our results show the possibility to sense the nano-crystal facets by appropriate choice of the substrate in ambient conditions.",

Vision plays a critical role in the representation of space development. During navigation, vision is integrated with auditory and mobility cues. In blind individuals, visual experience is not available and navigation therefore lacks this important sensory signal. In blind individuals, compensatory mechanisms can be adopted to improve spatial and navigation skills. On the other hand, the limitations of these compensatory mechanisms are not completely clear. Both enhanced and impaired reliance on auditory cues in blind individuals have been reported. Here, we develop a new paradigm to test both auditory perception and navigation skills in blind and sighted individuals and to investigate the effect that visual experience has on the ability to reproduce simple and complex paths. During the navigation task, early blind, late blind and sighted individuals were required first to listen to an audio shape and then to recognize and reproduce it by walking. After each audio shape was presented, a static sound was played and the participants were asked to reach it. Movements were recorded with a motion tracking system. Our results show three main impairments specific to early blind individuals. The first is the tendency to compress the shapes reproduced during navigation. The second is the difficulty to recognize complex audio stimuli, and finally, the third is the difficulty in reproducing the desired shape: early blind participants occasionally reported perceiving a square but they actually reproduced a circle during the navigation task. We discuss these results in terms of compromised spatial reference frames due to lack of visual input during the early period of development.",

The blood brain barrier (BBB) represents a challenge in the development of new nano-delivery systems able to reach the central nervous system (CNS). In order to test the efficacy of these nanocarriers, it is fundamental to use in vitro models that resemble the in vivo cell culture conditions. Here, we demonstrate for the first time the ability of a membranotropic peptide, namely gH625, to transport a cargo—acting as a shuttle—across the BBB layer under flow conditions that mimic the blood flow rate. To this aim, a BBB microfluidic device was designed based on a transparent polyester porous membrane sandwiched between a top and a bottom overlying channel made of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA). Our data clearly indicate that this microfluidic system allows the growth of brain endothelial bEnd.3 cells and the formation of a confluent layer at 7 days of culture that hinders the passage of nanoparticles compared to porous membrane alone. The device was validated at a 5 μL/min working flow rate, where the capability of the model to remain intact after nanoparticle passage was shown. Very interestingly, the decoration with the gH625 peptide enhances the adhesion of nanoparticles to the endothelial layer and the BBB crossing in flow conditions, thus confirming the efficacy of the gH625 as a delivery platform to the brain.

Here, we developed a technique based on patterned two-photon illumination to allow fast scanless imaging of GCaMP6 signals in the intact mouse brain at the same time as single-photon optogenetic inhibition with Archaerhodopsin. Using combined imaging and electrophysiological recording, we demonstrate that single and short bursts of action potentials in pyramidal neurons can be detected in the scanless modality at acquisition frequencies up to 1 kHz. Moreover, we demonstrate that our system strongly reduces the artifacts in the fluorescence detection that are induced by single-photon optogenetic illumination. Finally, we validated our technique investigating the role of parvalbumin-positive (PV) interneurons in the control of spontaneous cortical dynamics.

In organic light-emitting transistors, the structural properties such as the in-plane geometry and the lateral charge injection are the key elements that enable the monolithic integration of multiple electronic, optoelectronic, and photonic functions within the same device. Here, the realization of highly integrated multifunctional optoelectronic organic device is reported by introducing a high-capacitance photonic crystal as a gate dielectric into a transparent single-layer ambipolar organic light-emitting transistor (OLET). By engineering the photonic crystal multistack and bandgap, it is showed that the integration of the photonic structure has a twofold effect on the optoelectronic performance of the device, i.e., i) to modulate the spectral profile and outcoupling of the emitted light and ii) to enhance the transistor source-drain current by a 25-fold factor. Consequently, the photonic-crystal-integrated OLET shows an order of magnitude higher emitted power and brightness with respect to the corresponding polymer-dielectric device, while presenting as-designed electroluminescence spectral and spatial distribution. The results validate the efficacy of the proposed approach that is expected to unravel the technological potential for the realization of highly integrated optoelectronic smart systems based on organic light-emitting transistors.",

The development of large-scale production methods of two-dimensional (2D) crystals, with on-demand control of the area and thickness, is mandatory to fulfill the potential applications of such materials for photovoltaics. Inverted bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cell (OSC), which exploits a polymer-fullerene binary blend as the active material, is one potentially important application area for 2D crystals. A large ongoing effort is indeed currently devoted to the introduction of 2D crystals in the binary blend to improve the charge transport properties. While it is expected that the nanoscale domains size of the different components of the blend will significantly impact the performance of the OSC, to date, there is no evidence of quantitative information on the interplay between 2D crystals and fullerene domains size. Here, we demonstrate that by matching the size of WSe2 few-layer 2D crystals, produced by liquid-phase exfoliation, with that of the PC71BM fullerene domain in BHJ OSCs, we obtain power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of ∼9.3%, reaching a 15% improvement with respect to standard binary devices (PCE = 8.10%), i.e., without the addition of WSe2 flakes. This is the highest ever reported PCE for 2D material-based OSCs, obtained thanks to the enhanced exciton generation and exciton dissociation at the WSe2-fullerene interface and also electron extraction to the back metal contact as a consequence of a balanced charge carriers mobility. These results push forward the implementation of transition-metal dichalcogenides to boost the performance of BHJ OSCs.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 American Chemical Society. Intercalation and deintercalation of Cu into and from Bi2Se3 and Bi2Te3 colloidal nanocrystals is demonstrated in solid state. For this purpose, the nanocrystals are deposited on a solid substrate and subjected to moderate heating in the presence of a Cu source or a Cu scavenger. The results of the solid state experiments are consistent with those produced by solution-based intercalation. At moderate levels of solid state intercalation above about 10 at%, Cu forms superlattice structures in both Bi2Se3 and Bi2Te3, while higher intercalation levels ultimately lead to cation exchange. This is particularly the case in Bi2Se3 which transitions to Cu2-xSe while maintaining the two-dimensional morphology of the starting nanocrystals. The solid state intercalation is reversible, and Cu can also be deintercalated from the Bi2Se3 and Bi2Te3 nanocrystals upon heating and utilized in other reactions on the solid substrate. The extent of intercalation and deintercalation, however, depends on any interaction between the intercalant and host nanocrystals in response to heating. The concepts explored here hold promise for future development of novel solid state based energy storage nanodevices or possibly NC-based devices whose properties and/or function could be reversibly modulated through a combination of solid state CE and intercalation/deintercalation.",

Chitosan nanoparticles were prepared by ionic gelation using different weight ratios between chitosan (CH) and tripolyphosphate (TPP). Nanoparticles were characterized in terms of size, zeta potential, yield, encapsulation efficiency, stability and drug release. Finally, the antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus as well as in vitro cytotoxicity on HaCaT cells were evaluated. The best formulation CH/TPP 4:1 was selected based on the encapsulation efficiency and yield. Spanish Broom fibers impregnated with loaded nanoparticles showed an increased antibacterial activity against S. aureus compared to the same fibers containing VM without nanoparticles. Moreover, these fibers were not toxic to HaCaT keratinocytes cells. In conclusion, Spanish Broom fibers impregnated with VM loaded CH/TPP nanoparticles would appear to be a promising candidate for wound dressing application.",

            "abstract": "© 2017 Baldassarre, Pontil and Mourão-Miranda. Structured sparse methods have received significant attention in neuroimaging. These methods allow the incorporation of domain knowledge through additional spatial and temporal constraints in the predictive model and carry the promise of being more interpretable than non-structured sparse methods, such as LASSO or Elastic Net methods. However, although sparsity has often been advocated as leading to more interpretable models it can also lead to unstable models under subsampling or slight changes of the experimental conditions. In the present work we investigate the impact of using stability/reproducibility as an additional model selection criterion1 on several different sparse (and structured sparse) methods that have been recently applied for fMRI brain decoding. We compare three different model selection criteria: (i) classification accuracy alone; (ii) classification accuracy and overlap between the solutions; (iii) classification accuracy and correlation between the solutions. The methods we consider include LASSO, Elastic Net, Total Variation, sparse Total Variation, Laplacian and Graph Laplacian Elastic Net (GraphNET). Our results show that explicitly accounting for stability/reproducibility during the model optimization can mitigate some of the instability inherent in sparse methods. In particular, using accuracy and overlap between the solutions as a joint optimization criterion can lead to solutions that are more similar in terms of accuracy, sparsity levels and coefficient maps even when different sparsity methods are considered.",

Research across the cognitive and brain sciences has begun to elucidate some of the processes that guide navigation and spatial memory. Boundary geometry and featural landmarks are two distinct classes of environmental cues that have dissociable neural correlates in spatial representation and follow different patterns of learning. Consequently, spatial navigation depends both on the type of cue available and on the type of learning provided. We investigated this interaction between spatial representation and memory by administering two different tasks (working memory, reference memory) using two different environmental cues (rectangular geometry, striped landmark) in mouse models of human genetic disorders: Prader-Willi syndrome (PWScrm+/p− mice, n = 12) and Beta-catenin mutation (Thr653Lys-substituted mice, n = 12). This exploratory study provides suggestive evidence that these models exhibit different abilities and impairments in navigating by boundary geometry and featural landmarks, depending on the type of memory task administered. We discuss these data in light of the specific deficits in cognitive and brain function in these human syndromes and their animal model counterparts.",

Several skin equivalent models have been developed to investigate in vitro the re-epithelialization process occurring during wound healing. Although these models recapitulate closure dynamics of epithelial cells, they fail to capture how a wounded connective tissue rebuilds its 3D architecture until the evolution in a scar. Here, the in vitro tissue repair dynamics of a connective tissue is replicated by using a 3D human dermis equivalent (3D-HDE) model composed of fibroblasts embedded in their own extracellular matrix (ECM). After inducing a physical damage, 3D-HDE undergoes a series of cellular and extracellular events quite similar to those occurring in the native dermis. In particular, fibroblasts differentiation toward myofibroblasts phenotype and neosynthesis of hyaluronic acid, fibronectin, and collagen during the repair process are assessed. Moreover, tissue reorganization after physical damage is investigated by measuring the diameter of bundles and the orientation of fibers of the newly formed ECM network. Finally, the ultimate formation of a scar-like tissue as physiological consequence of the repair and closure process is demonstrated. Taking together, the results highlight that the presence of cell-assembled and responsive stromal components enables quantitative and qualitative in vitro evaluation of the processes involved in scarring during wound healing.",

A long-standing question is how the brain creates continuity between these reference frames across successive eye movements (saccades). Here we use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to address whether spatially specific repetition suppression (RS) is evident during trans-saccadic perception. We presented two successive Gabor patches (S1 and S2) in either the upper or lower visual field, left or right of fixation. Spatial congruency was manipulated by having S1 and S2 occur in the same or different upper/lower visual field. On half the trials, a saccade was cued between S1 and S2, placing spatiotopic and retinotopic reference frames in opposition. Equivalent RS was observed in the posterior parietal cortex and frontal eye fields when S1-S2 were spatiotopically congruent, irrespective of whether retinotopic and spatiotopic coordinates were in accord or were placed in opposition by a saccade. Additionally the post-saccadic response to S2 demonstrated spatially-specific RS in retinotopic visual regions, with stronger RS in extrastriate than striate cortex. Collectively, these results are consistent with a robust trans-saccadic spatial updating mechanism for object position that directly influences even the earliest levels of visual processing.",

Starch granules within the bio-elastomers affected the release of the antioxidant molecule betanin in the RB powder. The bio-elastomers were hydrophobic and resisted dissolution in water, hence the release of betanin was due to diffusion rather than polymer matrix disintegration. Hydrophobicity was maintained even after water immersion. Released betanin demonstrated highly efficient antioxidant scavenging activity against 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl free radical (DPPH) and 2,2′-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) radical cation (ABTS+). RB powder was also found to increase the Young's modulus of the bio-elastomers without compromising their elongation ability. Infrared spectral analysis indicated weak interactions through hydrogen bonding among starch granules, RB powder and PDMS polymer within the bio-elastomers. Hence, as a simple but intelligent biomaterial consisting of mainly edible starch and RB powder the present bio-elastomers can be used in active packaging for a variety of pharmaceutical, medical, and food applications.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 IEEE. Most humanoid robots walk in an unhuman-like way with bent knees due to the use of the simplified Linear Inverted Pendulum Model (LIPM) which constrains the Center of Mass (CoM) in a horizontal plane. Therefore it results in high knee joint torque and extra energy consumption. To address this issue, we propose a simple yet efficient control strategy to realize straight leg walking. First, theoretical analyses of simplified models provide insight into Zero Moment Point (ZMP) deviations during straight knee walking. Based on the finding that the deviation is limited comparing to the support polygon, we decide to keep using the LIPM for high-level planning, but let the robot perform straight leg walking automatically via the optimization-based low-level controller. By setting the desired CoM height slightly over the robot's reachable height, the low-level controller will attempt to straighten the robot's leg to reach this vertical reference, in the meanwhile, also satisfy the constraints (i.e. dynamic feasibility, friction cone, torque limits). The simulation results of the humanoid robot WALK-MAN demonstrate the feasibility of proposed control strategy with relatively high energy efficiency. A typical butterfly shape of CoM trajectory was also observed in the frontal plane which is common in human walking.",

Yet it is crucial to establish whether light absorption creates uncorrelated electron-hole pairs or bound excitons and, in the latter case, to determine their character. Here, by combining steady-state angleresolved photoemission spectroscopy and spectroscopic ellipsometry with state-of-the-art ab initio calculations, we demonstrate that the direct optical gap of single crystals is dominated by a strongly bound exciton rising over the continuum of indirect interband transitions. This exciton possesses an intermediate character between the Wannier-Mott and Frenkel regimes and displays a peculiar two-dimensional wavefunction in the three-dimensional lattice. The nature of the higher-energy excitations is also identified. The universal validity of our results is confirmed up to room temperature by observing the same elementary excitations in defect-rich samples (doped single crystals and nanoparticles) via ultrafast two-dimensional deep-ultraviolet spectroscopy.",

The active cis conformation of CA-4 can readily isomerize into a thermodynamically more stable but significantly less active trans form. Here, we solved the high-resolution crystal structure of cis-CA-4 in complex with tubulin. The compound binds to the colchicine site of tubulin and displays both common and distinct interaction points with colchicine. Using metadynamics simulations, we generated the trans form of the ligand within its binding site and computed the relative binding free energy of the cis-CA-4 and trans-CA-4 isomers via a thermodynamic cycle. The calculations suggest structural distortions of the bound trans-CA-4 molecule as the likely cause of its reduced activity in comparison with that of its cis isomer. Our findings could open up unique possibilities for structure-guided drug engineering with the aim of discovering combretastatin variants with improved chemical properties and pharmacological profiles.",

A combination of electrochemical, spectroscopic, computational, and kinetic studies has been used to elucidate the key mechanistic aspects of the previously reported enantioselective iminium ion trapping of photochemically generated carbon-centered radicals. The process, which provides a direct way to forge quaternary stereocenters with high fidelity, relies on the interplay of two distinct catalytic cycles: the aminocatalytic electron-relay system, which triggers the stereoselective radical trap upon iminium ion formation, and the photoredox cycle, which generates radicals under mild conditions. Critical to reaction development was the use of a chiral amine catalyst, bearing a redox-active carbazole unit, which could rapidly reduce the highly reactive and unstable intermediate generated upon radical interception. The carbazole unit, however, is also involved in another step of the electron-relay mechanism: the transiently generated carbazole radical cation acts as an oxidant to return the photocatalyst into the original state. By means of kinetic and spectroscopic studies, we have identified the last redox event as being the turnover-limiting step of the overall process. This mechanistic framework is corroborated by the linear correlation between the reaction rate and the reduction potential of the carbazole unit tethered to the aminocatalyst. The redox properties of the carbazole unit can thus be rationally tuned to improve catalytic activity. This knowledge may open a path for the mechanistically driven design of the next generation of electron-relay catalysts.",

An environmentally friendly perfluorinated acrylic copolymer (PFAC) primer coating layer was applied first, in order to enhance adhesion with the substrate and prolong abrasion resistance. The best nanocomposite composition was found to be 50% silica nanoparticles with respect to HIPS by weight. This coating displayed the lowest friction coefficient compared to other nanocomposites with lower or higher silica concentrations. Tribological experiments on the best performing nanocomposites indicated that wear tracks or marks had no debris, cracks or complete material removal. Furthermore, Taber® abrasion tests confirmed tribological findings and showed that the best nanocomposites resisted superhydrophobic degradation up to 35 continuous linear abrasion cycles (15 kPa). Nanocomposites made with general purpose polystyrene instead of HIPS could only resist up to 15 Taber® abrasion cycles. The reason was attributed to the mechanical energy dissipation capability of rubber domains in HIPS. Thermal annealing of the coatings had a deterministic effect on the durability of the coatings against wear induced loss of superhydrophobicity. Annealed and non-annealed coatings were characterized by Fourier transform infrared and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Due to ease of fabrication, resultant mechanical robustness, use of non-toxic materials, and low-cost industrial scale availability of HIPS, nanoparticles and the primer polymer, these coatings can be effortlessly transformed into larger scale non-wettable protective treatments for metals.",

            "abstract": "© 2017 World Scientific Publishing Company. Whether premotor/motor neurons encode information in terms of spiking frequency or by their relative time of firing, which may display synchronization, is still undetermined. To address this issue, we used an information theory approach to analyze neuronal responses recorded in the premotor (area F5) and primary motor (area F1) cortices of macaque monkeys under four different conditions of visual feedback during hand grasping. To evaluate the sensitivity of spike timing correlation between single neurons, we investigated the stimulus dependent synchronization in our population of pairs. We first investigated the degree of correlation of trial-to-trial fluctuations in response strength between neighboring neurons for each condition, and second estimated the stimulus dependent synchronization by means of an information theoretical approach. We compared the information conveyed by pairs of simultaneously recorded neurons with the sum of information provided by the respective individual cells. The information transmission across pairs of cells in the primary motor cortex seems largely independent, whereas information transmission across pairs of premotor neurons is summed superlinearly. The brain could take advantage of both the accuracy provided by the independency of F1 and the synergy allowed by the superlinear information population coding in F5, distinguishing thus the generalizing role of F5.",

            "abstract": "© 2017 The Author(s). Background: Deficits of kinesthesia (limb position and movement sensation) commonly limit sensorimotor function and its recovery after neuromotor injury. Sensory substitution technologies providing synthetic kinesthetic feedback might re-establish or enhance closed-loop control of goal-directed behaviors in people with impaired kinesthesia. Methods: As a first step toward this goal, we evaluated the ability of unimpaired people to use vibrotactile sensory substitution to enhance stabilization and reaching tasks. Through two experiments, we compared the objective and subjective utility of two forms of supplemental feedback- limb state information or hand position error- to eliminate hand position drift, which develops naturally during stabilization tasks after removing visual feedback. Results: Experiment 1 optimized the encoding of limb state feedback; the best form included hand position and velocity information, but was weighted much more heavily toward position feedback. Upon comparing optimal limb state feedback vs. hand position error feedback in Experiment 2, we found both encoding schemes capable of enhancing stabilization and reach performance in the absence of vision. However, error encoding yielded superior outcomes- objective and subjective- due to the additional task-relevant information it contains. Conclusions: The results of this study have established the immediate utility and relative merits of two forms of vibrotactile kinesthetic feedback in enhancing stabilization and reaching actions performed with the arm and hand in neurotypical people. These findings can guide future development of vibrotactile sensory substitution technologies for improving sensorimotor function after neuromotor injury in survivors who retain motor capacity, but lack proprioceptive integrity in their more affected arm.",

Thin anodic porous alumina (tAPA) was fabricated from a 500 nm thick aluminum (Al) layer coated on silicon wafers, through single-step anodization performed in a Teflon electrochemical cell in 0.4 M aqueous phosphoric acid at 110 V. Post-fabrication etching in the same acid allowed obtaining tAPA surfaces with ≈160 nm pore diameter and ≈80 nm corresponding wall thickness to be prepared. The tAPA surfaces were made SERS-active by coating with a thin (≈25 nm) gold (Au) layer. The as obtained tAPA-Au substrates were incubated first with different thiols, namely mercaptobenzoic acid (MbA) and aminothiol (AT), and then with phospholipid vesicles of different composition to form a supported lipid bilayer (SLB). At each step, the SERS substrate functionality was assessed, demonstrating acceptable enhancement (≥100×). The chemisorption of thiols during the first step and the formation of SLB from the vesicles during the second step, were independently monitored by using a quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D) technique. The SLB membranes represent a simplified model system of the living cells membranes, which makes the successful observation of SERS on these films promising in view of the use of tAPA-Au substrates as a platform for the development of surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) biosensors on living cells. In the future, these tAPA-Au-SLB substrates will be investigated also for drug delivery of bioactive agents from the APA pores.",

Synapsins (Syns) are synaptic vesicle-associated phosphoproteins involved in neuronal development and neurotransmitter release. While Syns are implicated in the regulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-induced neurotransmitter release, their role in the BDNF developmental effects has not been fully elucidated. By using primary cortical neurons from Syn I knockout (KO) and Syn I/II/III KO mice, we studied the effects of BDNF and nerve growth factor (NGF) on axonal growth. While NGF had similar effects in all genotypes, BDNF induced significant differences in Syn KO axonal outgrowth compared to wild type (WT), an effect that was rescued by the re-expression of Syn I. Moreover, the significant increase of axonal branching induced by BDNF in WT neurons was not detectable in Syn KO neurons. The expression analysis of BDNF receptors in Syn KO neurons revealed a significant decrease of the full length TrkB receptor and an increase in the levels of the truncated TrkB.t1 isoform and p75NTR associated with a marked reduction of the BDNF-induced MAPK/Erk activation. By using the Trk inhibitor K252a, we demonstrated that these differences in BDNF effects were dependent on a TrkB/p75NTR imbalance. The data indicate that Syn I plays a pivotal role in the BDNF signal transduction during axonal growth.",

            "abstract": "© 2017 Elsevier Ltd. Endocannabinoids (eCBs) are a family of lipid molecules that act as key regulators of synaptic transmission and plasticity. They are synthetized \"on demand\" following physiological and/or pathological stimuli. Once released from postsynaptic neurons, eCBs typically act as retrograde messengers to activate presynaptic type 1 cannabinoid receptors (CB1) and induce short- or long-term depression of neurotransmitter release. Besides this canonical mechanism of action, recent findings have revealed a number of less conventional mechanisms by which eCBs regulate neural activity and synaptic function, suggesting that eCB-mediated plasticity is mechanistically more diverse than anticipated. These mechanisms include non-retrograde signaling, signaling via astrocytes, participation in long-term potentiation, and the involvement of mitochondrial CB1. Focusing on paradigmatic brain areas, such as hippocampus, striatum, and neocortex, we review typical and novel signaling mechanisms, and discuss the functional implications in normal brain function and brain diseases. In summary, eCB signaling may lead to different forms of synaptic plasticity through activation of a plethora of mechanisms, which provide further complexity to the functional consequences of eCB signaling.",

As entry point to address that question we chose DICER, an endoribonuclease essential for miRNA biogenesis and other RNAi-related processes. By specific ablation of Dicer in aNSCs in vivo and in vitro, we demonstrate that miRNAs are required for the generation of new neurons, but not astrocytes, in the adult murine hippocampus. Moreover, we identify 11 miRNAs, of which 9 have not been previously characterized in neurogenesis, that determine neurogenic lineage fate choice of aNSCs at the expense of astrogliogenesis. Finally, we propose that the 11 miRNAs sustain adult hippocampal neurogenesis through synergistic modulation of 26 putative targets from different pathways.",

Central composite design (CCD) was applied to optimize some important factors involved in the mechanical coating procedure. Three factors including milling time, rotation per minute and employed technique (PLD + MM and MM) were examined as numerical, numerical, and categorical factors, respectively. Coating thickness, microhardness, and scratch hardness number were defined as process responses. The study revealed that the effect of all factors on the responses was significant. Optimum levels obtained using the response surface method (optimization levels: 27 h, 350 rpm and PLD + MM method) met the corresponding experimental results. The obtained results proved that CCD can be efficiently used in predicting behavior of the given system. Regarding the optimized condition, it was observed that combination of PLD and MM methods presents better outcomes.

In particular, we show that: i) with a photonic crystal made of i different materials, the photonic band gap splits in i-1 bands; ii) with a proper choice of the layer thickness, disordered photonic structures made with a high number of layers show periodic transmission peaks; iii) when the size of the hRI layer clusters, randomly distributed within the low refractive index layers, follows a power law distribution, the total light transmission follows a sigmoidal function. Furthermore, we discuss the fabrication aspects to realize the above mentioned photonic structures.",

            "abstract": "Copyright © 2017 Agnese Denzi et al. Recently, the use of nanometer liposomes as nanocarriers in drug delivery systems mediated by nanoelectroporation has been proposed. This technique takes advantage of the possibility of simultaneously electroporating liposomes and cell membrane with 10-nanosecond pulsed electric fields (nsPEF) facilitating the release of the drug from the liposomes and at the same time its uptake by the cells. In this paper the design and characterization of a 10 nsPEF exposure system is presented, for liposomes electroporation purposes. The design and the characterization of the applicator have been carried out choosing an electroporation cuvette with 1 mm gap between the electrodes. The structure efficiency has been evaluated at different experimental conditions by changing the solution conductivity from 0.25 to 1.6 S/m. With the aim to analyze the influence of device performances on the liposomes electroporation, microdosimetric simulations have been performed considering liposomes of 200 and 400 nm of dimension with different inner and outer conductivity (from 0.05 to 1.6 S/m) in order to identify the voltage needed for their poration.",

Previous studies suggest that the sense of agency (SoA), the feeling of control about one's own actions and ensuing effects is also generated during action selection processes. We investigate whether the conflict at the action selection stage induced by a supraliminal stimulus, modulates an implicit measure of SoA, namely intentional binding. Furthermore, we were interested to investigate the influence of different types of stimulus-response compatibility on SoA. To this aim we compared the influence of an automatic imitation task and a stroop-like task on intentional binding. In both tasks participants performed congruent and incongruent fingers movements (key release) in response to an external stimulus. Their movements caused an effect and participants estimated the time between their action and the ensuing effect. We found a reduced intentional binding effect in incongruent compared to congruent conditions in both tasks. The results are discussed within the theoretical framework of the fluency of action.",

This ability has been suggested to be the basis for identifying conspecifics from birth, hence representing a fundamental skill for the development of social interaction. Inspired by this, we propose a computational model to detect biological motion in video sequences acquired by the iCub humanoid robot, as a first step to improve its action understanding and interaction capabilities in a developmental perspective. We propose a temporal multi-resolution motion description which automatically copes with different dynamics and builds on top of low-level features that capture biological motion regularities. The starting point of the representation is the optical flow, a low-level measurement which simulates the limited amount of visual information available at birth. The description is evaluated in its capability to discriminate between biological and non-biological movements. We show how a temporal multi-resolution descriptor can effectively deal with dynamic events of variable temporal duration and complexity. Then we provide evidence that our approach guarantees a robust classification of biological versus non-biological video sequences, which generalizes to new scenarios, including new agents and new actions, also in presence of severe occlusions.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 Elsevier Inc. Background Action inhibition is a complex decision process that can be triggered by external factors (exogenous) or internal decisions (endogenous). While the neuronal underpinnings of exogenous action inhibition have been extensively investigated, less is known about the brain areas responsible for endogenous action inhibition. Objective We used inhibitory repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to test the causal role of two brain areas, the left dorsal fronto-median Cortex (dFMC) and the right Inferior Frontal Cortex (rIFC) in exogenous and endogenous action inhibition. Methods The exogenous condition was a modified version of the Go/NoGo paradigm, where a green stimulus served as a cue to perform an action (a button press, Exogenous-Go), while a magenta stimulus indicated that action should be withhold (Exogenous-NoGo). Crucially, for the endogenous condition we psychophysically generated a shade of colour that participants randomly categorized as green or magenta. This unique stimulus, randomly intermixed with green and magenta stimuli, forced participants to perform an endogenous (internally-driven) choice to either execute or inhibit the action. Results In the endogenous condition, at baseline participants executed the action on half the trials; however, after 1-Hz rTMS over the dFMC they responded significantly more frequently, indicating a reduced response inhibition. The effect was selective for the dFMC stimulation and sustained in time. Moreover, no significant effects were found in the exogenous condition. Conclusions These results support the causal role of the left dFMC in endogenous action inhibition and, more generally, the notion of separate brain circuits for endogenous and exogenous action inhibition.",

Studying the reaction kinetics of the UV curing process by means of real-time infrared spectroscopy showed that the polymerization rate and the final conversion of epoxy groups was related to the loading level of GO in the nanocomposites. An autocatalytic kinetics model of the curing reaction confirmed the effect of GO nanoparticles on the curing rate constant (k), the order of the initiation reaction (m) and the ultimate conversion of the UV-cured nanocomposites. Appropriate experimental observations indicated that dispersion of GO within the resin plays a critical role on the cure kinetics and final conversion. The results of the kinetics modeling and morphological observations showed that the curing rate constant of the nanocomposites is highly dependent on the GO content and its dispersion state, indicating that GO prevents epoxy resin crosslinking by photoinitator deactivation. Moreover, oxygen functionalities, such as hydroxyl and carboxyl groups, on the surface of GO facilitate interfacial interactions between epoxy groups from the matrix and GO. Electrical conductivity measurements demonstrated that the UV-induced photo-cured GO filled resins are conductive SU8 nanocomposites. It was observed that the thermal stability of the nanocomposites is enhanced due to the dispersion of GO in the matrix. Moreover, the microhardness analysis showed that addition of GO to neat SU8 increases the mechanical hardness of the nanocomposite. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry.",

Mirror neurons (MNs) are a fascinating class of cells originally discovered in the ventral premotor cortex (PMv) and, subsequently, in the inferior parietal lobule (IPL) of the macaque, which become active during both the execution and observation of actions. In this review, I will first highlight the mounting evidence indicating that mirroring others' actions engages a broad system of reciprocally connected cortical areas, which extends well beyond the classical IPL-PMv circuit and might even include subcortical regions such as the basal ganglia. Then, I will present the most recent findings supporting the idea that the observation of one's own actions, which might play a role in the ontogenetic origin and tuning of MNs, retains a particular relevance within the adult MN system. Finally, I will propose that both cortical and subcortical mechanisms do exist to decouple MN activity from the motor output, in order to render it exploitable for high-order perceptual, cognitive, and even social functions. The findings reviewed here provide an original framework for envisaging the main challenges and experimental directions of future neurophysiological and neuroanatomical studies of the monkey MN system.",

Many studies on the microbiome of animals have been reported but a comprehensive analysis is lacking. Here we present a meta-analysis on the microbiomes of arthropods and their terrestrial habitat, focusing on the functional profile of bacterial communities derived from metabolic traits that are essential for microbial life. We report a detailed analysis of probably the largest set of biochemically defined functional traits ever examined in microbiome studies. This work deals with the phylum proteobacteria, which is usually dominant in marine and terrestrial environments and covers all functions associated with microbiomes. The considerable variation in the distribution and abundance of proteobacteria in microbiomes has remained fundamentally unexplained. This analysis reveals discrete functional groups characteristic for adaptation to anaerobic conditions, which appear to be defined by environmental filtering of taxonomically related taxa. The biochemical diversification of the functional groups suggests an evolutionary trajectory in the structure of arthropods' microbiome, from metabolically versatile to specialized proteobacterial organisms that are adapted to complex environments such as the gut of social insects. Bacterial distribution in arthropods' microbiomes also shows taxonomic clusters that do not correspond to functional groups and may derive from other factors, including common contaminants of soil and reagents.",

DS affects multiple organs, but it invariably results in altered brain development and diverse degrees of intellectual disability. A large body of evidence has shown that synaptic deficits and memory impairment are largely determined by altered GABAergic signaling in trisomic mouse models of DS. These alterations arise during brain development while extending into adulthood, and include genesis of GABAergic neurons, variation of the inhibitory drive and modifications in the control of neural-network excitability. Accordingly, different pharmacological interventions targeting GABAergic signaling have proven promising preclinical approaches to rescue cognitive impairment in DS mouse models. In this review, we will discuss recent data regarding the complex scenario of GABAergic dysfunctions in the trisomic brain of DS mice and patients, and we will evaluate the state of current clinical research targeting GABAergic signaling in individuals with DS.",

In addition to its known effects on cardiac muscle, recent in vitro and in vivo evidence highlighted its potential for anticancer properties. Here, we evaluated for the first time the effect of oleandrin on brain tumors. To this aim, mice were transplanted with human or murine glioma and analyzed for tumor progression upon oleandrin treatment. In both systems, oleandrin impaired glioma development, reduced tumor size, and inhibited cell proliferation. We demonstrated that oleandrin does the following: (1) enhances the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) level in the brain; (2) reduces both microglia/macrophage infiltration and CD68 immunoreactivity in the tumor mass; (3) decreases astrogliosis in peritumoral area; and (4) reduces glioma cell infiltration in healthy parenchyma. In BDNF-deficient mice (bdnftm1Jae/J) and in glioma cells silenced for TrkB receptor expression, oleandrin was not effective, indicating a crucial role for BDNF in oleandrin’s protective and antitumor functions. In addition, we found that oleandrin increases survival of temozolomide-treated mice. These results encourage the development of oleandrin as possible coadjuvant agent in clinical trials of glioma treatment.",

The specific role of early visual deprivation on spatial hearing is still unclear, mainly due to the difficulty of comparing similar spatial skills at different ages and to the difficulty in recruiting young blind children from birth. In this study, the effects of early visual deprivation on the development of auditory spatial localization have been assessed in a group of seven 3-5 years old children with congenital blindness (n = 2; light perception or no perception of light) or low vision (n = 5; visual acuity range 1.1-1.7 LogMAR), with the main aim to understand if visual experience is fundamental to the development of specific spatial skills. Our study led to three main findings: firstly, totally blind children performed overall more poorly compared sighted and low vision children in all the spatial tasks performed; secondly, low vision children performed equally or better than sighted children in the same auditory spatial tasks; thirdly, higher residual levels of visual acuity are positively correlated with better spatial performance in the dynamic condition of the auditory localization task indicating that the more residual vision the better spatial performance. These results suggest that early visual experience has an important role in the development of spatial cognition, even when the visual input during the critical period of visual calibration is partially degraded like in the case of low vision children. Overall these results shed light on the importance of early assessment of spatial impairments in visually impaired children and early intervention to prevent the risk of isolation and social exclusion.",

In this work, to deeply explore the mechanism by which 45A ncRNA contributes to cancer development, we targeted in vitro and in vivo 45A levels by the stable overexpression of antisense 45A RNA. 45A downregulation leads to deep modifications of cytoskeleton organization, adhesion and migration of neuroblastoma cells. These effects are correlated with alterations in the expression of several genes including GTSE1 (G2 and S phaseexpressed- 1), a crucial regulator of tumor cell migration and metastatic potential. Interestingly, the downregulation of 45A ncRNA strongly affects the in vivo tumorigenic potential of SKNBE2 neuroblastoma cells, increasing tumor nodule compactness and reducing GTSE1 protein expression in a subcutaneous neuroblastoma mouse model. Moreover, intracardiac injection of neuroblastoma cells showed that downregulation of 45A ncRNA also influences tumor metastatic ability. In conclusion, our data highlight a key role of 45A ncRNA in cancer development and suggest that its modulation might represent a possible novel anticancer therapeutic approach.",

Dysregulated lncRNA expression has been documented in several human cancers, and their tissuespecificity makes them attractive candidates as diagnostic/prognostic biomarkers and/or therapeutic agents. Here we show that linc-NeD125, which we previously characterized as a neuronal-induced lncRNA, is significantly overexpressed in Group 4 medulloblastomas (G4 MBs), the largest and least well characterized molecular MB subgroup. Mechanistically, linc-NeD125 is able to recruit the miRNA-induced silencing complex (miRISC) and to directly bind the microRNAs miR-19a-3p, miR-19b-3p and miR-106a-5p. Functionally, linc-NeD125 acts as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) that, sequestering the three miRNAs, leads to de-repression of their targets CDK6, MYCN, SNCAIP, and KDM6A, which are major driver genes of G4 MB. Accordingly, linc-NeD125 downregulation reduces G4 cell proliferation. Moreover, we also provide evidence that linc-NeD125 ectopic expression in the aggressive Group 3 MB cells attenuates their proliferation, migration and invasion. This study unveils the first lncRNA-based ceRNA network in central nervous system tumours and provides a novel molecular circuit underlying the enigmatic Group 4 medulloblastoma.",

These transformations are mediated by circuits linking specific inferior parietal with ventral premotor areas in which sensory coding of objects’ features automatically triggers appropriate hand motor programs. Recently, connectional studies in macaques showed that these parietal and premotor areas are nodes of a large-scale cortical network, designated as “lateral grasping network,” including specific temporal and prefrontal sectors involved in object recognition and executive functions, respectively. These data extend grasping models so far proposed in providing a possible substrate for interfacing perceptual, cognitive, and hand-related sensorimotor processes for controlling hand actions based on object identity, goals, and memory-based or contextual information and for the contribution of motor signals to cognitive motor functions. Human studies provided evidence for a possible counterpart of the macaque lateral grasping network, suggesting that in primate evolution the neural mechanisms for controlling hand actions described in the macaque have been retained and exploited for the emergence of human-specific motor and cognitive motor capacities.",

First, we show that: (i) forward locomotion on flat ground can be learned rapidly (minutes of optimization time); (ii) a simulation study reveals that a passive knee configuration leads to faster, more stable, and more efficient locomotion than a variant of the robot with active knees; (iii) the robot is capable of learning turning gaits as well. The merits of underactuation (reduced controller complexity, weight, and energy consumption) are thus preserved without compromising the versatility of behavior. Direct optimization on the reduced space of active joints leads to effective learning of model-free controllers. Second, we find passive compliant joints with potentiometers to effectively complement inertial sensors in a velocity estimation task and to outperform inertial and pressure sensors in a terrain detection task. Encoders on passive compliant joints thus constitute a cheap and compact but powerful sensing device that gauges joint position and force/torque, and — if mounted more distally than the last actuated joints in a legged robot — it delivers valuable information about the interaction of the robot with the ground.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 The Authors Heterozygous and rare homozygous mutations in PRoline-Rich Transmembrane protein 2 (PRRT2) underlie a group of paroxysmal disorders including epilepsy, kinesigenic dyskinesia episodic ataxia and migraine. Most of the mutations lead to impaired PRRT2 expression and/or function. Recently, an important role for PRTT2 in the neurotransmitter release machinery, brain development and synapse formation has been uncovered. In this work, we have characterized the phenotype of a mouse in which the PRRT2 gene has been constitutively inactivated (PRRT2 KO). β-galactosidase staining allowed to map the regional expression of PRRT2 that was more intense in the cerebellum, hindbrain and spinal cord, while it was localized to restricted areas in the forebrain. PRRT2 KO mice are normal at birth, but display paroxysmal movements at the onset of locomotion that persist in the adulthood. In addition, adult PRRT2 KO mice present abnormal motor behaviors characterized by wild running and jumping in response to audiogenic stimuli that are ineffective in wild type mice and an increased sensitivity to the convulsive effects of pentylentetrazol. Patch-clamp electrophysiology in hippocampal and cerebellar slices revealed specific effects in the cerebellum, where PRRT2 is highly expressed, consisting in a higher excitatory strength at parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synapses during high frequency stimulation. The results show that the PRRT2 KO mouse reproduces the motor paroxysms present in the human PRRT2-linked pathology and can be proposed as an experimental model for the study of the pathogenesis of the disease as well as for testing personalized therapeutic approaches.",

            "abstract": "Denisovite is a rare mineral occurring as aggregates of fibres typically 200-500 14;nm diameter. It was confirmed as a new mineral in 1984, but important facts about its chemical formula, lattice parameters, symmetry and structure have remained incompletely known since then. Recently obtained results from studies using microprobe analysis, X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD), electron crystallography, modelling and Rietveld refinement will be reported. The electron crystallography methods include transmission electron microscopy (TEM), selected-Area electron diffraction (SAED), high-Angle annular dark-field imaging (HAADF), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), precession electron diffraction (PED) and electron diffraction tomography (EDT). A structural model of denisovite was developed from HAADF images and later completed on the basis of quasi-kinematic EDT data by ab initio structure solution using direct methods and least-squares refinement. The model was confirmed by Rietveld refinement. The lattice parameters are a = 31.024 14;(1), b = 19.554 14;(1) and c = 7.1441 14;(5) 14;Å, β = 95.99 14;(3)°, V = 4310.1 14;(5) 14;Å3 and space group P12/a1. The structure consists of three topologically distinct dreier silicate chains, viz.Two xonotlite-like dreier double chains, [Si6O17]10-, and a tubular loop-branched dreier triple chain, [Si12O30]12-. The silicate chains occur between three walls of edge-sharing (Ca,Na) octahedra. The chains of silicate tetrahedra and the octahedra walls extend parallel to the z axis and form a layer parallel to (100). Water molecules and K+ cations are located at the centre of the tubular silicate chain. The latter also occupy positions close to the centres of eight-membered rings in the silicate chains. The silicate chains are geometrically constrained by neighbouring octahedra walls and present an ambiguity with respect to their z position along these walls, with displacements between neighbouring layers being either Δz = c/4 or-c/4. Such behaviour is typical for polytypic sequences and leads to disorder along [100]. In fact, the diffraction pattern does not show any sharp reflections with l odd, but continuous diffuse streaks parallel to ainstead. Only reflections with l even are sharp. The diffuse scattering is caused by (100) nano lamellae separated by stacking faults and twin boundaries. The structure can be described according to the order-disorder (OD) theory as a stacking of layers parallel to (100).",

The study of bimanual movements has allowed to describe an interesting phenomenon known as the bimanual coupling effect: a lack of independence between the two hands that induces an interference process, which has been reported in both the spatial and temporal domain. Here, we studied for the first time the electro-cortical activity of the temporal bimanual coupling effect, specifically focused on the motor preparation of the two hands movements. Participants performed congruent movements, with both hands heading towards easy or difficult targets, and incongruent movements, with the two hands heading to separate targets (i.e. left to the easy target and right to the difficult target). Motor Related Cortical Potentials (MRCPs) showed no effect of conditions or difficulty on the early phase of the activity (posterior and anterior BP). Additionally, the two hands were prepared together, as if a single movement was about to start. As such, behavioral results showed strong synchronization between the hands, which always tended to start and end their movement together. Importantly, the effect of movement difficulty was present at the movement onset and just after it when the movement unfolded. Coherently with behavioral results, difficult movements generated a strong Post-motor potential (N4), more prominent when the right hand was heading towards the difficult target. Our findings show that bimanual movements are actually planned and programmed as a single motor program, but movement difficulty emerges in the execution of the action.",

KGaA, WeinheimTissue engineering/regenerative medicine (TERM) is an interdisciplinary field that applies the principle of engineering and life sciences to restore/replace damaged tissues/organs with in vitro artificially-created ones. Research on TERM quickly moves forward. Today newest technologies and discoveries, such as 3D-/bio-printing, allow in vitro fabrication of ex-novo made tissues/organs, opening the door to wide and probably never-ending application possibilities, from organ transplant to drug discovery, high content screening and replacement of laboratory animals. Imaging techniques are fundamental tools for the characterization of tissue engineering (TE) products at any stage, from biomaterial/scaffold to construct/organ analysis. Indeed, tissue engineers need versatile imaging methods capable of monitoring not only morphological but also functional and molecular features, allowing three-dimensional (3D) and time-lapse in vivo analysis, in a non-destructive, quantitative, multidimensional analysis of TE constructs, to analyze their pre-implantation quality assessment and their fate after implantation. This review focuses on the newest developments in imaging technologies and applications in the context of requirements of the different steps of the TERM field, describing strengths and weaknesses of the current imaging approaches.

The precise localization of nanometric objects in three dimensions is essential to identify functional diffusion mechanisms in complex systems at the cellular or molecular level. However, most optical methods can achieve high temporal resolution and high localization precision only in two dimensions or over a limited axial (z) range. Here we develop a novel wide-field detection system based on an electrically tunable lens that can track multiple individual nanoscale emitters in three dimensions over a tunable axial range with nanometric localization precision. The optical principle of the technique is based on the simultaneous acquisition of two images with an extended depth of field while encoding the z position of the emitters via a lateral shift between images. We provide a theoretical framework for this approach and demonstrate tracking of free diffusing beads and GABAA receptors in live neurons. This approach allows getting nanometric localization precision up to an axial range above 10 µm with a high numerical aperture lens-quadruple that of a typical 3D tracking system. Synchronization or complex fitting procedures are not requested here, which leads to a suitable architecture for localizing single molecules in four dimensions, namely, three dimensions in real-time.",

This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited. Metabolomics is an emerging field of cell biology that aims at the comprehensive identification of metabolite levels in biological fluids or cells in a specific functional state. Currently, the major tools for determining metabolite concentrations are mass spectrometry coupled with chromatographic techniques and nuclear magnetic resonance, which are expensive, time consuming and destructive for the samples. Here, we report a time resolved approach to monitor metabolite dynamics in cell cultures, based on Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS). This method is label-free, easy to use and provides the opportunity to simultaneously study a broad range of molecules, without the need to process the biological samples. As proof of concept, NIH/3T3 cells were cultured in vitro, and the extracellular medium was collected at different time points to be analyzed with our engineered SERS substrates. By identifying individual peaks of the Raman spectra, we showed the simultaneous detection of several components of the conditioned medium, such as L-tyrosine, Ltryptophan, glycine, L-phenylalanine, L-histidine and fetal bovine serum proteins, as well as their intensity changes during time. Furthermore, analyzing the whole Raman data set with the Principal Component Analysis (PCA), we demonstrated that the Raman spectra collected at different days of culture and clustered by similarity, described a well-defined trajectory in the principal component plot. This approach was then utilized to determine indirectly the functional state of the macrophage cell line Raw 264.7, stimulated with the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 24 hours. The collected spectra at different time points, clustered by the PCA analysis, followed a well-defined trajectory, corresponding to the functional change of cells toward the activated pro-inflammatory state induced by the LPS. This study suggests that our engineered SERS surfaces can be used as a versatile tool both for the characterization of cell culture conditions and the functional state of cells over time.",

            "abstract": "© 2017 The Author Molecules are continuously shuttling across the nuclear envelope barrier that separates the nucleus from the cytoplasm. Instead of being just a barrier to diffusion, the nuclear envelope is rather a complex filter that provides eukaryotes with an elaborate spatiotemporal regulation of fundamental molecular processes, such as gene expression and protein translation. Given the highly dynamic nature of nucleocytoplasmic transport, during the past few decades large efforts were devoted to the development and application of time resolved, fluorescence-based, biophysical methods to capture the details of molecular motion across the nuclear envelope. These methods are here divided into three major classes, according to the differences in the way they report on the molecular process of nucleocytoplasmic transport. In detail, the first class encompasses those methods based on the perturbation of the fluorescence signal, also known as ensemble-averaging methods, which average the behavior of many molecules (across many pores). The second class comprises those methods based on the localization of single fluorescently-labelled molecules and tracking of their position in space and time, potentially across single pores. Finally, the third class encompasses methods based on the statistical analysis of spontaneous fluorescence fluctuations out of the equilibrium or stationary state of the system. In this case, the behavior of single molecules is probed in presence of many similarly-labelled molecules, without dwelling on any of them. Here these three classes, with their respective pros and cons as well as their main applications to nucleocytoplasmic shuttling will be briefly reviewed and discussed.",

The data were compared to fluid flow models developed by Darcy and Bramhall demonstrating that neither of these models were able to accurately describe the experimental results, highlighting the need for development of new models.

The coupled spin-valley physics is affected by the topological band inversion in a nontrivial way; while the valley-dependent spin polarization of both conduction and valence bands is preserved, a change of the Berry curvature and of spin-valley selection rules is predicted, leading to different circular dichroic response as well as valley and spin Hall effects.",

            "abstract": "© 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York. During any goal oriented behavior the dual processes of generation of dexterous actions and anticipation of the consequences of potential actions must seamlessly alternate. This article presents a unified neural framework for generation and forward simulation of goal directed actions and validates the architecture through diverse experiments on humanoid and industrial robots. The basic idea is that actions are consequences of an simulation process that animates the internal model of the body (namely the body schema), in the context of intended goals/constraints. Specific focus is on (a) Learning: how the internal model of the body can be acquired by any robotic embodiment and extended to coordinated tools; (b) Configurability: how diverse forward/inverse models of action can be ‘composed’ at runtime by coupling/decoupling different body (body + tool) chains with task relevant goals and constraints represented as multi-referential force fields; and (c) Computational simplicity: how both the synthesis of motor commands to coordinate highly redundant systems and the ensuing forward simulations are realized through well-posed computations without kinematic inversions. The performance of the neural architecture is demonstrated through a range of motor tasks on a 53-DoFs robot iCub and two industrial robots performing real world assembly with emphasis on dexterity, accuracy, speed, obstacle avoidance, multiple task-specific constraints, task-based configurability. Putting into context other ideas in motor control like the Equilibrium Point Hypothesis, Optimal Control, Active Inference and emerging studies from neuroscience, the relevance of the proposed framework is also discussed.",

Nano-crystalline silicon attracts scientific and technological interest due to its unique tunable optical and electronic properties, which could open up the way to novel applications in fields like photovoltaics, electronics and optoelectronics. Nevertheless, the high processing temperatures and low throughputs of standard synthesis routes hinder many possible technological advances. This work presents a high-throughput technique for room-temperature synthesis of highly crystalline nanoparticle-assembled silicon thin films. Its distinctive feature is the segmentation of the deposition process in two steps: (i) nanoparticle (NP) synthesis in non-thermal plasma, and (ii) ballistic growth of NP-assembled films through a supersonic jet. Nanoparticle-assembled silicon films showing up to 50% of the bulk silicon density are synthesized with crystalline fractions and crystallite sizes in the 0-72% and 2-5.5 nm ranges, respectively. A time-of-flight technique is employed to gain insights into the transport mechanisms of charge carrier films. Photocurrent transients show dispersive behavior with mobility values up to 1.2 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, the highest thus far reported for nanoparticle-assembled silicon films directly deposited at low-temperature. A proof-of-concept field-effect transistor is fabricated by impacting NPs onto a pre-patterned substrate, demonstrating hole-current modulation. This technique holds great promises for the integration of Si-based semiconductor technology with roll-to-roll manufactured flexible electronics.",

The resultant solutions were cast into fully transparent antimicrobial films. Proper concentrations of acetic acid eliminated in situ crystallization of the antibiotic and the resultant phase separation upon solvent evaporation. The solutions could also be electrospun into nanofiber mats (non-transparent). Presence of residual PVP-bound acetic acid in dry PVP films induced unprecedented levels of plasticity (stretching capacity) and softness to the films. Additionally, PVP-bound acetic acid also acted as an antiseptic. Antibacterial properties of the films and fiber mats were confirmed on Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis (growth and viability). Films and nanofiber mats demonstrated promising wound resorption characteristics by using in vivo full-thickness excisional skin wound healing mice model. Nanofiber mats were resorbed much faster than transparent films. Wound exudate absorption in the films and resorption rate of the nanofiber mats were dependent on the starting acetic acid concentrations. The fact that PVP/Cipro solutions in aqueous acetic acid can be used either to produce transparent soft films or nanofiber mats renders this process highly suitable for the fabrication of new-generation potential dressings for wound management and care.",

This heterostructure is prepared by reacting the as-synthesized CuS nanocrystals (NCs) with Pd2+ cations at room temperature in the presence of an electron donor (ascorbic acid). The reaction starts from the surface of the CuS NCs and proceeds toward the center, causing reorganization of the initial lattice and amorphization of the covellite structure. According to density functional calculations, Pd atoms are preferentially accommodated between the bilayer formed by the S-S covalent bonds, which are therefore broken, and this can be understood as the first step leading to amorphization of the particles upon insertion of the Pd2+ ions. The position and intensity in near-infrared LSPRs can be tuned by altering the thickness of the shell and are in agreement with the theoretical optical simulation based on the Mie-Gans theory and Drude model. Compared to the starting CuS NCs, the amorphous CuPdxS shell in the core-shell nanoparticles makes their plasmonic response less sensitive to a harsh oxidation environment (generated, for example, by the presence of I2).",

KGaA, Weinheim Intracellular pH is a key parameter in many biological mechanisms and cell metabolism and is used to detect and monitor cancer formation and brain or heart diseases. pH-sensing is typically performed by fluorescence microscopy using pH-responsive dyes. Accuracy is limited by the need for quantifying the absolute emission intensity in living biological samples. An alternative with a higher sensitivity and precision uses probes with a ratiometric response arising from the different pH-sensitivity of two emission channels of a single emitter. Current ratiometric probes are complex constructs suffering from instability and cross-readout due to their broad emission spectra. Here, we overcome such limitations using a single-particle ratiometric pH probe based on dot-in-bulk CdSe/CdS nanocrystals (NCs). These nanostructures feature two fully-separated narrow emissions with different pH sensitivity arising from radiative recombination of core- and shell-localized excitons. The core emission is nearly independent of the pH, whereas the shell luminescence increases in the 3–11 pH range, resulting in a cross-readout-free ratiometric response as strong as 600%. In vitro microscopy demonstrates that the ratiometric response in biologic media resembles the precalibralation curve obtained through far-field titration experiments. The NCs show good biocompatibility, enabling us to monitor in real-time the pH in living cells.",

Different accounts of our ability to use tools have been proposed. In the first part of the paper we review the most prominent interpretations and suggest that none of these accounts, considered in itself, is sufficient to explain tool use. In the second part of the paper we disentangle three different types of reasoning on tools, characterized by a different distribution of motor and cognitive ingredients. At the conceptual level, these types of reasoning reflect the distinction between three types of abductive inference as they are described in semiotic studies. At the functional level, we suggest that these types of reasoning on tools may correspond to different mental processes, possibly implemented in different regions of the left inferior parietal lobe. This proposal can account for the different interpretations commonly associated with the role of the left parietal cortex in tool use.",

Hysteresis losses in magnetic nanoparticles constitute the basis of magnetic hyperthermia for delivering a local thermal stress. Nevertheless, this therapeutic modality is only to be realised through a careful appraisal of the best possible intrinsic and extrinsic conditions to the nanoparticles for which they maximise and preserve their heating capabilities. Low frequency (100 kHz) hysteresis loops accurately probe the dynamical magnetic response of magnetic nanoparticles in a more reliable manner than calorimetry measurements, providing conclusive quantitative data under different experimental conditions. We consider here a set of iron oxide or cobalt ferrite nanocubes of different sizes, through which we experimentally and theoretically study the influence of the viscosity of the medium on the low frequency hysteresis loops of magnetic colloids, and hence their ability to produce and dissipate heat to the surroundings. We analyse the role of nanoparticle size, size distribution, chemical composition, and field intensity in making the magnetisation dynamics sensitive to viscosity. Numerical simulations using the stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation model the experimental observations in excellent agreement. These results represent an important contribution towards predicting viscosity effects and hence to maximise heat dissipation from magnetic nanoparticles regardless of the environment.",

Automatic analysis of rodent behavior has been receiving growing attention in recent years since rodents have been the reference species for many neuroscientific studies, with the social interaction being among the subjects of the most important ones. Systems that are employed in these studies are mainly based on tracking of mice and activity classification through supervised learning methods, trained on datasets manually annotated by experts. In this paper, we introduce a completely unsupervised way of analysing tracking data for the automatic identification of social and non-social behaviors using models capable of spotting regularities in the data. In particular, a mean-covariance Restricted Boltzmann Machine is employed to abstract higher-level behavioral configurations of mice interacting in an arena for a long time.",

Exploiting the dense sampling of single neurons by multiple electrodes, an efficient, low-dimensional representation of detected spikes consisting of estimated spatial spike locations and dominant spike shape features is exploited for fast and reliable clustering into single units. Millions of events can be sorted in minutes, and the method is parallelized and scales better than quadratically with the number of detected spikes. Performance is demonstrated using recordings with a 4,096-channel array and validated using anatomical imaging, optogenetic stimulation, and model-based quality control. A comparison with semi-automated, shape-based spike sorting exposes significant limitations of conventional methods. Our approach demonstrates that it is feasible to reliably isolate the activity of up to thousands of neurons and that dense, multi-channel probes substantially aid reliable spike sorting.",

            "abstract": "© 2017 Elsevier Ltd The primate brain contains a hierarchy of visual areas, dubbed the ventral stream, which rapidly computes object representations that are both specific for object identity and robust against identity-preserving transformations, like depth rotations [1, 2]. Current computational models of object recognition, including recent deep-learning networks, generate these properties through a hierarchy of alternating selectivity-increasing filtering and tolerance-increasing pooling operations, similar to simple-complex cells operations [3–6]. Here, we prove that a class of hierarchical architectures and a broad set of biologically plausible learning rules generate approximate invariance to identity-preserving transformations at the top level of the processing hierarchy. However, all past models tested failed to reproduce the most salient property of an intermediate representation of a three-level face-processing hierarchy in the brain: mirror-symmetric tuning to head orientation [7]. Here, we demonstrate that one specific biologically plausible Hebb-type learning rule generates mirror-symmetric tuning to bilaterally symmetric stimuli, like faces, at intermediate levels of the architecture and show why it does so. Thus, the tuning properties of individual cells inside the visual stream appear to result from group properties of the stimuli they encode and to reflect the learning rules that sculpted the information-processing system within which they reside.",

            "abstract": "© 2017 World Scientific Publishing Company.Detecting affordances on objects is one of the main open problems in robotic manipulation. This paper presents a new method to represent and localize grasp affordances as bounded curved contact patches (paraboloids) of the size of the robotic hand. In particular, given a three-dimensional (3D) point cloud from a range sensor, a set of potential grasps is localized on a detected object by a fast contact patch fitting and validation process. For the object detection, three standard methods from the literature are used and compared. The potential grasps on the object are then refined to a single affordance using their shape (size and curvature) and pose (reachability and minimum torque effort) properties, with respect to the robot and the manipulation task. We apply the proposed method to a circular valve turning task, verifying the ability to accurately and rapidly localize grasp affordances, under significant uncertainty in the environment. We experimentally validate the method with the humanoid robot COMAN on 10 circular control valves fixed on a wall, from five different viewpoints and robot poses for each valve. We compare the reliability of the introduced local grasp affordances method to the baseline that relies only on object detection, illustrating the superiority of ours for the valve turning task.",

We measured the developmental trajectory of the discrimination of object size from observation of the biological motion of a grasping action in egocentric and allocentric viewpoints (observing action of others or self), in children and adolescents from 5 to 18 years of age. Children of 5–7 years of age performed the task at chance, indicating a delayed ability to understand the goal of the action. We found a progressive improvement in the ability of discrimination from 9 to 18 years, which parallels the development of fine motor control. Only after 9 years of age did we observe an advantage for the egocentric view, as previously reported for adults. Given that visual and haptic sensitivity of size discrimination, as well as biological motion, are mature in early adolescence, we interpret our results as reflecting immaturity of the influence of the motor system on visual perception.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 Visual perception is a fundamental component for most robotics systems operating in human environments. Specifically, visual recognition is a prerequisite to a large variety of tasks such as tracking, manipulation, human–robot interaction. As a consequence, the lack of successful recognition often becomes a bottleneck for the application of robotics system to real-world situations. In this paper we aim at improving the robot visual perception capabilities in a natural, human-like fashion, with a very limited amount of constraints to the acquisition scenario. In particular our goal is to build and analyze a learning system that can rapidly be re-trained in order to incorporate new evidence if available. To this purpose, we review the state-of-the-art coding–pooling pipelines for visual recognition and propose two modifications which allow us to improve the quality of the representation, while maintaining real-time performances: a coding scheme, Best Code Entries (BCE), and a new pooling operator, Mid-Level Classification Weights (MLCW). The former focuses entirely on sparsity and improves the stability and computational efficiency of the coding phase, the latter increases the discriminability of the visual representation, and therefore the overall recognition accuracy of the system, by exploiting data supervision. The proposed pipeline is assessed from a qualitative perspective on a Human–Robot Interaction (HRI) application on the iCub platform. Quantitative evaluation of the proposed system is performed both on in-house robotics data-sets (iCubWorld) and on established computer vision benchmarks (Caltech-256, PASCAL VOC 2007). As a byproduct of this work, we provide for the robotics community an implementation of the proposed visual recognition pipeline which can be used as perceptual layer for more complex robotics applications.",

            "abstract": "© 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. In this work, we present WALK-MAN, a humanoid platform that has been developed to operate in realistic unstructured environment, and demonstrate new skills including powerful manipulation, robust balanced locomotion, high-strength capabilities, and physical sturdiness. To enable these capabilities, WALK-MAN design and actuation are based on the most recent advancements of series elastic actuator drives with unique performance features that differentiate the robot from previous state-of-the-art compliant actuated robots. Physical interaction performance is benefited by both active and passive adaptation, thanks to WALK-MAN actuation that combines customized high-performance modules with tuned torque/velocity curves and transmission elasticity for high-speed adaptation response and motion reactions to disturbances. WALK-MAN design also includes innovative design optimization features that consider the selection of kinematic structure and the placement of the actuators with the body structure to maximize the robot performance. Physical robustness is ensured with the integration of elastic transmission, proprioceptive sensing, and control. The WALK-MAN hardware was designed and built in 11 months, and the prototype of the robot was ready four months before DARPA Robotics Challenge (DRC) Finals. The motion generation of WALK-MAN is based on the unified motion-generation framework of whole-body locomotion and manipulation (termed loco-manipulation). WALK-MAN is able to execute simple loco-manipulation behaviors synthesized by combining different primitives defining the behavior of the center of gravity, the motion of the hands, legs, and head, the body attitude and posture, and the constrained body parts such as joint limits and contacts. The motion-generation framework including the specific motion modules and software architecture is discussed in detail. A rich perception system allows the robot to perceive and generate 3D representations of the environment as well as detect contacts and sense physical interaction force and moments. The operator station that pilots use to control the robot provides a rich pilot interface with different control modes and a number of teleoperated or semiautonomous command features. The capability of the robot and the performance of the individual motion control and perception modules were validated during the DRC in which the robot was able to demonstrate exceptional physical resilience and execute some of the tasks during the competition.",

            "abstract": "IEEE The ability to use tools can significantly increase the range of activities that an agent is capable of. Humans start using external objects since an early age to accomplish their goals, learning from interaction and observation the relationship between the objects used, their own actions, and the resulting effects, i.e., the tool affordances. Robots capable of autonomously learning affordances in a similar self-supervised way would be far more versatile and simpler to design than purpose-specific ones. This paper proposes and evaluates an approach to allow robots to learn tool affordances from interaction, and generalize them among similar tools based on their 3D geometry. A set of actions is performed by the iCub robot with a large number of tools grasped in different poses, and the effects observed. Tool affordances are learned as a regression between tool-pose features and action-effect vector projections on respective Self-Organizing Maps, which enables the system to avoid categorization and keep gradual representations of both elements. Moreover, we propose a set of robot-centric 3D tool descriptors, and study their suitability for interaction scenarios, comparing also their performance against features derived from Deep Convolutional Neural Networks. Results show that the presented methods allow the robot to predict the effect of its tool use actions accurately, even for previously unseen tool and poses, and thereby to select the best action for a particular goal given a tool-pose.",

Actually, the contribution of body morphology to cognition and control is rarely computational, in any useful sense of the word. We thus distinguish (1) morphology that facilitates control, (2) morphology that facilitates perception, and the rare cases of (3) morphological computation proper, such as reservoir computing, where the body is actually used for computation. This result contributes to the understanding of the relation between embodiment and computation: The question for robot design and cognitive science is not whether computation is offloaded to the body, but to what extent the body facilitates cognition and control - how it contributes to the overall orchestration of intelligent behavior.",

How is this done? Using a spatial perspective task in which participants were asked to identify objects at specific locations, we found that self-perspective judgments were faster for objects presented to the right, rather than the left, and for objects presented closer to the participants’ own bodies. Strikingly, taking the opposing perspective of another person led to a reversal (i.e., remapping) of these effects, with reference to the other person’s position (Experiment 1). A remapping of spatial relations was also observed when an empty chair replaced the other person (Experiment 2), but not when access to the other viewpoint was blocked (Experiment 3). Thus, when the spatial scene allows a physically feasible but opposing point of view, people respond as if their own bodies were in that place. Imagination can thus overcome perception.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 The Authors Traditional industrial applications involve robots with limited mobility. Consequently, interaction (e.g. manipulation) was treated separately from whole-body posture (e.g. balancing), assuming the robot firmly connected to the ground. Foreseen applications involve robots with augmented autonomy and physical mobility. Within this novel context, physical interaction influences stability and balance. To allow robots to surpass barriers between interaction and posture control, forthcoming robotic research needs to investigate the principles governing whole-body motion and coordination with contact dynamics. There is a need to investigate the principles of motion and coordination of physical interaction, including the aspects related to unpredictability. Recent developments in compliant actuation and touch sensing allow safe and robust physical interaction from unexpected contact including humans. The next advancement for cognitive robots, however, is the ability not only to cope with unpredictable contact, but also to exploit predictable contact in ways that will assist in goal achievement. Last but not least, theoretical results needs to be validated in real-world scenarios with humanoid robots engaged in whole-body goal-directed tasks. Robots should be capable of exploiting rigid supportive contacts, learning to compensate for compliant contacts, and utilizing assistive physical interaction from humans. The work presented in this paper presents state-of-the-art in these domains as well as some recent advances made within the framework of the CoDyCo European project.",

Through the challenge of a Treasure Hunt, we intend to explore whether people tend to trust and rely on robot help, even when they are not instructed to do so. Results suggest that participants resort to robot support only when under pressure, but then follow with no hesitation its advice. In addition, we show that robot's perceived anthropomorphism and animacy increase, also when the robot help did not lead to subjects' victory at the game.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Alterations in the cytoskeleton structure are frequently found in several diseases and particularly in cancer cells. It is also through the alterations of the cytoskeleton structure that cancer cells acquire most of their common features such as uncontrolled cell proliferation, cell death evasion, and the gaining of migratory and invasive characteristics. Although radiation therapies currently represent one of the most effective treatments for patients, the effects of X-irradiation on the cytoskeleton architecture are still poorly understood. In this case we investigated the effects, over time of two different doses of X-ray irradiation, on cell cytoskeletons of BALB/c3T3 and Sv40-transformed BALB/c 3T3 cells (SVT2). Biophysical parameters – focal adhesion size, actin bundles organization, and cell mechanical properties – were measured before and after irradiations (1 and 2 Gy) at 24 and 72 h, comparing the cytoskeleton properties of normal and transformed cells. The differences, before and after X-irradiation, were revealed in terms of cell morphology and deformability. Finally, such parameters were correlated to the alterations of cytoskeleton dynamics by evaluating cell adhesion at the level of focal adhesion and cytoskeleton mechanics. X-irradiation modifies the structure and the activity of cell cytoskeleton in a dose-dependent manner. For transformed cells, radiation sensitively increased cell adhesion, as indicated by paxillin-rich focal adhesion, flat morphology, a well-organized actin cytoskeleton, and intracellular mechanics. On the other hand, for normal fibroblasts IR had negligible effects on cytoskeletal and adhesive protein organization. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

ASBTRACT: Zinc Oxide (ZnO) thin films have been addressed as promising candidates for the fabrication of Resistive Random Access Memory devices, which are alternative to conventional charge-based flash memories. According to the filamentary conducting model and charge trapping/detrapping theory developed in the last decade, the memristive behavior of ZnO thin films is explained in terms of conducting filaments formed by metallic ions and/or oxygen vacancies, and their breaking through electrochemical redox reactions and/or recombination of oxygen vacancies/ions. A comparative review of the memristive properties of ZnO thin films grown by sputtering, atomic layer deposition (ALD), pulsed laser deposition (PLD), and sol-gel methods is here proposed. Sputtered ZnO thin films show promising resistive switching behaviors, showing high on/off ratios (10–104), good endurance, and low operating voltages. ALD is also indicated to be useful for growing conformal ZnO layers with atomic thickness control, resulting in important resistive switching characteristics, such as relatively high on/off ratios and low operating voltages. High insulating epitaxial ZnO thin films can be obtained by PLD, showing reliable switching properties at low voltages and with good retention. On the contrary, the sol-gel approach generally results in ZnO thin films with poor resistive switching behaviors. Nevertheless, thin films derived from ZnO NPs show improved switching performances, with higher on/off ratios and lower operating voltages. Independently of the synthetic approach, doped ZnO thin films exhibit better resistive switching behaviors than pristine ones, coupling a strong increase of the on/off ratio with a more stable switching response.",

How intragenic microRNAs and their host genes are transcriptionally coregulated and their functional relationships for the control of neural stem cells (NSCs) are poorly understood. We propose here the intragenic miR-326 and its host gene β-arrestin1 as novel players whose epigenetic silencing maintains stemness in normal cerebellar stem cells. Such a regulation is mediated by CpG islands methylation of the common promoter. Epigenetic derepression of β-arrestin1/miR-326 by differentiation signals or demethylating agents leads to suppression of stemness features and cell growth and promotes cell differentiation. β-Arrestin1 inhibits cell proliferation by enhancing the nuclear expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27. Therefore, we propose a new mechanism for the control of cerebellar NSCs where a coordinated epigenetic mechanism finely regulates β-arrestin1/miR-326 expression and consequently NSCs stemness and cell growth.",

Three new metal-free organic dyes with the [1]benzothieno[3,2-b]benzothiophene (BTBT) π-bridge, having the structure donor-π-acceptor (D-π-A) and labeled as 19, 20 and 21, have been designed and synthesized for application in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC). Once the design of the π-acceptor block was fixed, containing the BTBT as the π-bridge and the cyanoacrylic group as the electron acceptor and anchoring unit, we selected three donor units with different electron-donor capacity, in order to assemble new chromophores with high molar extinction coefficients (ϵ), whose absorption features well reflect the good performance of the final DSSC devices. Starting with the 19 dye, which shows a molar extinction coefficient ϵ of over 14,000 M-1 cm-1 and takes into account the absorption maximun at the longer wavelength, the substitution of the BFT donor unit with the BFA yields a great enhancement of absorptivity (molar extinction coefficient ϵ &gt; 42,000 M-1 cm-1), until reaching the higher value (ϵ &gt; 69,000 M-1 cm-1) with the BFPhz donor unit. The good general photovoltaic performances obtained with the three dyes highlight the suitable properties of electron-transport of the BTBT as the π-bridge in organic chromophore for DSSC, making this very cheap and easy to synthesize molecule particularly attractive for efficient and low-cost photovoltaic devices.",

Additive Manufacturing (AM) technologies represent a solution for enabling astronauts to manufacture parts in situ, as needed, starting from feedstock material. The importance of these capabilities are particularly evident in manned space exploration missions, e.g. on human Mars missions, where a paramount cargo capability would be necessary to supply the astronauts with everything they may need during the mission. Also, item obtained by 3D printing process may have a lighter structure than if manufactured out of conventional process, thus helping in reducing overall mass at launch. The capability to make parts in space, during the mission, would dramatically reduce the mass sent to the destination site and also help astronauts in solving some of the problems that can occur during a space mission: if the Apollo had been equipped with a 3d printer, the filter housing with a suitable interface could have been easily manufactured by astronauts using Additive Manufacturing technology. The Portable on-Orbit Printer 3D represents the first European additive manufacturing experiment in space. The Printer implements the Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) process for the fabrication of parts using the PLA thermoplastic polymer. The objective of the experiment is to validate the 3D printing technology in microgravity and to pave the way for an Italian and European development of the additive manufacturing technology on board the ISS and, more in general, in space. Portable on-Orbit Printer 3D is a 3D printer developed by TAS-I together with ALTRAN and IIT. The project has been managed and funded by ASI in the frame of 2012 AO \"Bando Volo Umano Spaziale\". The Printer has been launched to ISS within the Cygnus module with OA-4 resupply mission (Atlas 5) on December 6th, 2015. The astronaut on-orbit operations are limited to activate the Built-In Test and the \"printing\" process that lasts about 50 minutes. At the end the printer is returned to Earth were the \"printed\" part is removed and analyzed. Scientific goal of the experiment is mainly to prove that FDM fabrication with a representative type of polymeric material is not significantly influenced by the gravity acceleration field. This paper will present the results of the demonstration activities performed on orbit and the results of the analysis performed on the on orbit \"printed\" part in comparison with the same part \"printed\" on ground.",

ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels have been initially identified as the main determinant of the reduction of neuronal hyperexcitability. However, a plethora of other mechanisms have been proposed. Herein, we report the ability of 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2-DG), a glucose analog that inhibits glycolytic enzymes, of potentiating γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic tonic inhibition via neurosteroid-mediated activation of extrasynaptic GABAA receptors. Methods: Acute effects of 2-DG on the ATP-sensitive potassium currents, GABAergic tonic inhibition, firing activity, and interictal events were assessed in hippocampal slices by whole-cell patch-clamp and local field potential recordings of dentate gyrus granule cells. Results: Acute application of 2-DG activates two distinct outward conductances: a KATP channel–mediated current and a bicuculline-sensitive tonic current. The effect of 2-DG on such GABAergic tonic currents was fully prevented by either finasteride or PK11195, which are specific inhibitors of the neurosteroidogenesis pathway acting via different mechanisms. Moreover, the oxidized form of vitamin C, dehydroascorbic acid, known for its ability to induce neurosteroidogenesis, also activated a bicuculline-sensitive tonic current in a manner indistinguishable from that of 2-DG. Finally, we found that the enhancement of KATP current by 2-DG primarily regulates intrinsic firing rate of granule cells, whereas the increase of the GABAergic tonic current plays a key role in reducing the frequency of interictal events evoked by treatment of hippocampal slices with the convulsive agent 4-aminopyridine. Significance: We demonstrated, for the first time, that 2-DG potentiates the extrasynaptic tonic GABAergic current through activation of neurosteroidogenesis. Such tonic inhibition represents the main conductance responsible for the antiseizure action of this glycolytic inhibitor.",

The coaxial structures are fabricated with a top-down method based on a template of hollow 3D antennas. Each antenna has a multilayer radial structure consisting of dielectric and metallic materials not achievable in a 2D configuration. A planar metallic layer is inserted normally to the antennas. The outer dielectric shell of the antenna defines a nanometric gap between the horizontal plane and the vertical walls. Thanks to this aperture, light can tunnel to the other side of the plane, and be transmitted to the far field in a set of resonances. These are investigated with finite-elements electromagnetic calculations and with Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy measurements. The spectral position of the resonances can be tuned by changing the lattice period and/or the antenna length. Thanks to the strong scattering provided by the 3D geometry, the transmission peaks possess a high signal-to-noise ratio even when the illuminated area is less than 2 × 2 times the operation wavelength. This opens new possibilities for multispectral imaging in the IR with wavelength-scale spatial resolution.",

In the study of neuronal networks or other cell cultures it is essential to combine information about a single element with the connections developed throughout the whole system. Those data come from different space and time scales, therefore requiring the employment of various techniques to be acquired and combined. Unfortunately, connecting data from more than one experiment is often challenging and the many variables involved make the results difficult to correlate. Here we present a platform able to merge different techniques on the same device, reducing the variability of the system under investigation thanks to the simultaneous study of the single element and the collective behavior of various in-vitro mammalian cell cultures.",

However, conventional SPIM architectures hardly permit imaging of certain tissues since the common sample mounting procedure, based on gel embedding, could interfere with the sample morphology. In this work we propose an inverted selective plane microscopy system (iSPIM), based on non-linear excitation, suitable for 3D tissue imaging. First, the iSPIM architecture provides flexibility on the sample mounting, getting rid of the gel-based mounting typical of conventional SPIM, permitting 3D imaging of hippocampal slices from mouse brain. Moreover, all the advantages brought by two photon excitation (2PE) in terms of reduction of scattering effects and contrast improvement are exploited, demonstrating an improved image quality and contrast compared to single photon excitation. The system proposed represents an optimal platform for tissue imaging and it smooths the way to the applicability of light sheet microscopy to a wider range of samples including those that have to be mounted on non-transparent surfaces.",

Several compounds have been explored to promote/catalyze oxidative polymerization of melanogenic precursors, such as 5,6-dihydroxyindole-2-carboxylic acid (DHICA), to melanin-like biopolymers in vitro. TiO2 has shown a photocatalytic activity driving DHICA polymerization and leading to the formation of melanin-TiO2 hybrid nanostructures with unique biocide behavior even under visible light. However, the mechanism of melanin formation in those hybrids is not yet well understood although a ligand to metal charge transfer (LMCT) process involving DHICA and Ti4+ ions was hypothesized. Here, we focus on melanin formation and apply a complementary analysis, by using photoluminescence (PL), UV-vis, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to reveal the mechanism of DHICA polymerization in the presence of a TiO2-sol. This study discloses TiO2 potentialities to drive and template DHICA polymerization to melanin via LMCT-based photo-oxidative process.",

A decoder translates recorded neural activity into motor commands and an encoder delivers sensory information collected from the environment directly to the brain creating a closed-loop system. These two modules are typically integrated in bulky external devices. However, the clinical support of patients with severe motor and sensory deficits requires compact, low-power, and fully implantable systems that can decode neural signals to control external devices. As a first step toward this goal, we developed a modular bidirectional BMI setup that uses a compact neuromorphic processor as a decoder. On this chip we implemented a network of spiking neurons built using its ultra-low-power mixed-signal analog/digital circuits. On-chip on-line spike-timing-dependent plasticity synapse circuits enabled the network to learn to decode neural signals recorded from the brain into motor outputs controlling the movements of an external device. The modularity of the BMI allowed us to tune the individual components of the setup without modifying the whole system. In this paper, we present the features of this modular BMI and describe how we con?gured the network of spiking neuron circuits to implement the decoder and to coordinate it with the encoder in an experimental BMI paradigm that connects bidirectionally the brain of an anesthetized rat with an external object. We show that the chip learned the decoding task correctly, allowing the interfaced brain to control the object's trajectories robustly. Based on our demonstration, we propose that neuromorphic technology is mature enough for the development of BMI modules that are sufficiently low-power and compact, while being highly computationally powerful and adaptive.",

We investigate the absorption spectra of photoexcited carriers in a prototypical anatase TiO2 nanoparticle using hybrid time dependent density functional theory calculations in water solution. Our results agree well with experimental transient absorption spectroscopy data and shed light on the character of the transitions. The trapped state is always involved, so that the SOMO/SUMO is the initial/final state for the photoexcited electron/hole absorption. For a trapped electron, final states in the low energy tail of the conduction band correspond to optical transitions in the IR, while final states at higher energy correspond to optical transitions in the visible. For a trapped hole, the absorption band is slightly blue-shifted and narrower in comparison to that of the electron, consistent with its deeper energy level in the band gap. Our calculations also show that electrons in shallow traps exhibit a broad absorption in the IR, resembling the feature attributed to conductive electrons in experimental spectra.",

To enhance today's artificial flow sensing capabilities in aerial and underwater robotics, future robots could be equipped with a large number of miniaturized sensors distributed over the surface to provide high resolution measurement of the surrounding fluid flow. In this work we show a linear array of closely separated bio-inspired micro-electro-mechanical flow sensors whose sensing mechanism is based on a piezoresistive strain-gauge along a stress-driven cantilever beam, mimicking the biological superficial neuromasts found in the lateral line organ of fishes. Aiming to improve state-of-the-art flow sensing capability in autonomously flying and swimming robots, our artificial lateral line system was designed and developed to feature multi-parameter freestream flow measurements which provide information about (1) local flow velocities as measured by the signal amplitudes from the individual cantilevers as well as (2) propagation velocity, (3) linear forward/backward direction along the cantilever beam orientation and (4) periodicity of pulses or pulse trains determined by cross-correlating sensor signals. A real-time capable cross-correlation procedure was developed which makes it possible to extract freestream flow direction and velocity information from flow fluctuations. The computed flow velocities deviate from a commercial system by 0.09 m s-1 at 0.5 m s-1 and 0.15 m s-1 at 1.0 m s-1 flow velocity for a sampling rate of 240 Hz and a sensor distance of 38 mm. Although experiments were performed in air, the presented flow sensing system can be applied to underwater vehicles as well, once the sensors are embedded in a waterproof micro-electro-mechanical systems package.",

This work explores the feasibility of using the Abrasive Fluidized Bed (AFB) method to finish flat AlSi10Mg substrates manufactured by Direct Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS). Finishing was performed by rotating the substrates inside a fluidized bed of abrasives at high speeds. The interaction between the fluidized abrasives and AlSi10Mg substrates has been investigated to analyze the influence of the operational parameters, namely, abrasive type and rotational speed, on the finishing performance. The morphological features of the substrates and geometrical tolerances have been inspected by field emission gun-scanning electron microscopy (FEG-SEM) and contact gauge profilometry. After short finishing cycles, the substrates featured a smoother surface morphology, while the edges were only influenced slightly by the abrasive impacts. Abrasive Fluidized Bed (AFB) can therefore be considered a potential easy-to-automate, low cost, low time consuming and sustainable finishing technology for metal parts obtained through additive manufacturing.",

We compare the data of the absolute nutrient concentrations, measured by PULCON external standard method, before and after precipitation of serum proteins and those obtained using CPMG (Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill) sequence or applying post-processing filtering algorithms to remove, from the 1H q-NMR spectra, the proteins signal contribution.

Rationale: Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOFMS) is frequently used to analyze homo- and copolymers, i.e. for computing copolymer fingerprints. However, the oligomer abundances are influenced by mass discrimination, i.e. mass- and composition-dependent ionization. We have developed a computational method to correct the abundance bias caused by the mass discrimination. Methods: MALDI-TOFMS in combination with computational methods was used to investigate three random copolymers with different ratios of styrene and isoprene. Furthermore, equimolar high- and low-mass styrene and isoprene homopolymers (2500 and 4200 Da) were mixed and also analyzed by MALDI-TOFMS. The abundances of both copolymers and homopolymers were corrected for mass discrimination effects with our new method. Results: The novel computational method was integrated into the existing COCONUT software. The method was demonstrated using the measured styrene and isoprene co- and homopolymers. First, the method was applied to homopolymer spectra. Subsequently, the copolymer fingerprint was computed from the copolymer MALDI mass spectra and the correcting function applied. The changes in the composition are plausible, indicating that correction of copolymer abundances was reasonable. Conclusions: Our computational method may help to avoid erroneous conclusions when analyzing copolymer MS spectra. The software is freely available and represents a step towards comprehensive computational support in polymer science. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.",

Based on neutron powder diffraction (NPD) and high angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM), we show that calcium ions help eliminate the Fe-antisite defects by controlling the nucleation and evolution of the LiFePO4 particles during their hydrothermal synthesis. This Ca-regulated formation of LiFePO4 particles has an overwhelming impact on the removal of their iron antisite defects during the subsequent carbon-coating step since (i) almost all the Fe-antisite defects aggregate at the surface of the LiFePO4 crystal when the crystals are small enough and (ii) the concomitant increase of the surface area, which further exposes the Fe-antisite defects. Our results not only justify a low-cost, efficient and reliable hydrothermal synthesis method for LiFePO4 but also provide a promising alternative viewpoint on the mechanism controlling the nanosizing of LiFePO4, which leads to improved electrochemical performances.",

Conversely, accurate results can be obtained using orbital-dependent functionals in the optimized effective potential (OEP) approach. In this article, we investigate the performance, in this context, of some advanced OEP methods, with special emphasis on the recently proposed scaled-opposite-spin OEP functional. Moreover, we analyze the impact of the so-called HOMO condition on the final quality of the HOMO energy.

            "abstract": "© 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc. Published in the U.S.A. Acid ceramidase (AC) is a lysosomal cysteine amidase that controls sphingolipid signaling by lowering the levels of ceramides and concomitantly increasing those of sphingosine and its bioactive metabolite, sphingosine 1-phosphate. In the present study, we evaluated the role of AC-regulated sphingolipid signaling in melanoma. We found that AC expression is markedly elevated in normal human melanocytes and proliferative melanoma cell lines, compared with other skin cells (keratinocytes and fibroblasts) and non-melanoma cancer cells. High AC expression was also observed in biopsies from human subjects with Stage II melanoma. Immunofluorescence studies revealed that the subcellular localization of AC differs between melanocytes (where it is found in both cytosol and nucleus) and melanoma cells (where it is primarily localized to cytosol). In addition to having high AC levels, melanoma cells generate lower amounts of ceramides than normal melanocytes do. This downregulation in ceramide production appears to result from suppression of the de novo biosynthesis pathway. To test whether ACmight contribute to melanoma cell proliferation, we blocked AC activity using a new potent (IC50 = 12 nM) and stable inhibitor. AC inhibition increased cellular ceramide levels, decreased sphingosine 1-phosphate levels, and acted synergistically with several, albeit not all, antitumoral agents. The results suggest that AC-controlled sphingolipid metabolism may play an important role in the control of melanoma proliferation.",

The adoption of a classification approach as an identification strategy in a model-based fault diagnosis process represents a major innovation in the field of SOFC plants. Constant-voltage and constant-current control strategies are investigated. In both cases, an adequately trained SVM classifier is used to provide a high probability of correct classification when the plant functions at different steady-state operating conditions for random sizes of the considered faults and for realistic magnitudes of the errors affecting the model predictions.

Here, a Lattice Boltzmann and Immersed Boundary methods are combined together for predicting the near wall dynamics of particles with different shapes in a laminar flow. For the lattice Boltzmann modelling, a Gauss-Hermite projection is used to derive the lattice equation; wall boundary conditions are imposed through the Zou-He framework; and a moving least squares algorithm accurately reconstructs the forcing term accounting for the immersed boundary. First, the computational code is validated against two well-known test cases: the sedimentation of circular and elliptical cylinders in a quiescent fluid. A very good agreement is observed between the present results and those available in the literature. Then, the transport of circular, elliptical, rectangular, square and triangular particles is analyzed in a Couette flow, at Re=20. All particles drifted laterally across the stream lines reaching an equilibrium position, independently of the initial conditions. For this large Reynolds number, the particle shape has no significant effect on the final equilibrium position but it does affect the absolute value and periodicity of the angular velocity. Specifically, elongated particles show longer oscillation periods and, most interestingly, larger variations in angular velocity. The longest particles exhibit a zero angular velocity for almost the whole rotational period. Collectively, this data demonstrates that the proposed approach can be efficiently used for predicting complex particle dynamics in biologically relevant flows. This computational strategy could have significant impact in the field of computational nanomedicine for optimizing the specific delivery of therapeutic and imaging agents.",

The proposed computational strategy consists in: (i) solving a preliminary optimization problem that roughly approximates the original one, but differs from it by one or more conveniently chosen parameters and is faster to solve; (ii) using the obtained solution as an initial guess for the actual (full-fledged) optimal control problem. The performance of the method is evaluated in a simulated planar system, whose peculiarity is to be trivially underactuated. An extensive investigation is presented which shows how a proper choice of the parameters in the preliminary optimization can lead to a significant reduction in the computational effort required to solve the problem.

            "abstract": "© 2015 John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd Very little is known about the action observation network and the mirror neuron system (AON/MNS) in children and its age-related properties compared with those observed in adults. In the present fMRI study we explored the activation of areas belonging to the AON/MNS in children and adults during observation of complex hand-grasping actions, as compared to observation of simple grasping acts executed with the left and the right hand, seen from a first person perspective. The results indicate that during the action observation tasks in children there was activation of a cortical network similar to that found in adults, including the premotor cortex, the posterior part of the inferior frontal gyrus and the posterior parietal lobe. However, the activation in children was more widespread and showed a higher inter-subject variability compared with adults. Furthermore, the activated network seems more lateralized to the left hemisphere in adults and more bilateral in children, with a linear growth of lateralization index as a function of age. Finally, in children the activation in the anterior intraparietal cortex (AIP) of each hemisphere was higher during observation of the contralateral hand (hand identity effect) and during the observation of complex actions relative to simple grasping acts, confirming the role of AIP for action-related hand identity previously described in adults. These results support the assumption that structure and size of action representations are sensitive to mechanisms of development and show physiological plasticity. These properties of the AON/MNS could constitute a powerful tool for spontaneous reorganization and recovery of motor deficits after brain injury in children and in adults, as well as for specific rehabilitation programmes.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 IEEE.In this paper we present an efficient active learning strategy applied to the problem of tactile exploration of an object's surface. The method uses Gaussian process (GPs) classification to efficiently sample the surface of the object in order to reconstruct its shape. The proposed method iteratively samples the surface of the object, while, simultaneously constructing a probabilistic model of the object's surface. The probabilities in the model are used to guide the exploration. At each iteration, the estimate of the object's shape is used to slice the object in equally spaced intervals along the height of the object. The sampled locations are then labelled according to the interval in which their height falls. In its simple form, the data are labelled as belonging to the object and not belonging to the object: object and no-object, respectively. A GP classifier is trained to learn the object/no-object decision boundary. The next location to be sampled is selected at the classification boundary, in this way, the exploration is biased towards more informative areas. Complex features of the object's surface is captured by increasing the number of intervals as the number of sampled locations is increased. We validated our approach on six objects of different shapes using the iCub humanoid robot. Our experiments show that the method outperforms random selection and previous work based on GP regression by sampling more points on and near-the-boundary of the object.",

In this study we investigated the acute effects (within 1 h) of T2 administration to hypothyroid rats on liver mitochondria fatty acid uptake and β-oxidation rate, mitochondrial efficiency (by measuring proton leak) and mitochondrial oxidative damage (by determining H2O2 release). Fatty acid uptake into mitochondria was measured assaying carnitine palmitoyl transferase (CPT) I and II activities, and fatty acid β-oxidation using palmitoyl-CoA as a respiratory substrate. Mitochondrial fatty acid pattern was defined by gas-liquid chromatography. In hypothyroid + T2 vs hypothyroid rats we observed a raise in the serum level of nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA), in the mitochondrial CPT system activity and in the fatty acid β-oxidation rate. A parallel increase in the respiratory chain activity, mainly from succinate, occurs. When fatty acids are chelated by bovine serum albumin, a T2-induced increase in both state 3 and state 4 respiration is observed, while, when fatty acids are present, mitochondrial uncoupling occurs together with increased proton leak, responsible for mitochondrial thermogenesis. T2 administration decreases mitochondrial oxidative stress as determined by lower H2O2 production. We conclude that in rat liver mitochondria T2 acutely enhances the rate of fatty acid β-oxidation, and the activity of the downstream respiratory chain. The T2-induced increase in proton leak may contribute to mitochondrial thermogenesis and to the reduction of oxidative stress. Our results strengthen the previously reported ability of T2 to reduce adiposity, dyslipidemia and to prevent liver steatosis.",

The robot initially imitates the human to perform the collaborative task in a leader-follower setting, using a feedback about the human motor behaviour. Simultaneously, the robot obtains the skill in online manner. When a predetermined level of human fatigue is detected, the robot uses the learnt skill to take over the physically demanding aspect of the task and contributes to a significant reduction of the human effort. The human, on the other hand, controls and supervises the high-level interaction behaviour and performs the aspects that require the contribution of both agents in such a dynamic co-manipulation setup. The robot adaptation system is based on the Dynamical Movement Primitives, Locally Weighted Regression and Adaptive Frequency Oscillators. The estimation of the human motor fatigue is carried out using a proposed online model, which is based on the human muscle activity measured by the electromyography. We demonstrate the proposed method with experiments on a real-world co-manipulation task with environmental constraints and dynamic uncertainties.",

Our method progressively acquires an image in the wavelet domain by predicting the significant coefficients. For this, we base our technique on the non-linear approximation of the wavelet transform taking advantage of the transformation's sparsity.

Spinobulbarmuscular atrophy (SBMA) is an X-linked neuromuscular disease caused by polyglutamine (polyQ) expansion in the androgen receptor (AR) gene. SBMA belongs to the family of polyQ diseases, which are fatal neurodegenerative disordersmainly caused by protein-mediated toxic gain-of-function mechanisms and characterized by deposition of misfolded proteins in the formof aggregates. The neurotoxicity of the polyQproteins can bemodified by phosphorylation at specific sites, thereby providing the rationale for the development of disease-specific treatments.We sought to identify signaling pathways thatmodulate polyQ-AR phosphorylation for therapy development.Wereport that cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) phosphorylates polyQ-AR specifically at Ser96. Phosphorylation of polyQ-AR by CDK2 increased protein stabilization and toxicity and is negatively regulated by the adenylyl cyclase (AC)/protein kinase A (PKA) signaling pathway. To translate these findings into therapy, we developed an analog of pituitary adenylyl cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP), a potent activator of the AC/PKA pathway. Chronic intranasal administration of the PACAP analog to knock-in SBMA mice reduced Ser96 phosphorylation, promoted polyQ-AR degradation, and ameliorated disease outcome. These results provide proof of principle that noninvasive therapy based on the use of PACAP analogs is a therapeutic option for SBMA.",

A controller with feedback linearization is one of the methods to compensate the effects of the non-linearity and the natural feedback. However, since the method is based on the model parameters of the hydraulic actuator, the control performance is affected by modeling errors and modeling uncertainties. Therefore, a robust controller for the hydraulic actuator is proposed to complement the disadvantage of the conventional method. To design the proposed controller, a part of the feedback linearization, that is, pressure (nonlinearity) compensation is used to linearize the hydraulic pressure dynamics virtually. By using the virtually linearized hydraulic dynamics and the nominal mass, the nominal model of the hydraulic pressure and that of the load motion dynamics model are designed. Then, the effects which prevent each dynamics from behaving as the nominal models are defined as disturbances. In the proposed controller, two types of the observers are designed to compensate the disturbances. In this paper, the design details are shown and the validity of the proposed method is shown by simulation and experiments.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 Emanuele Rizzuto et al.Tissue engineering is a multidisciplinary science based on the application of engineering approaches to biologic tissue formation. Engineered tissue internal organization represents a key aspect to increase biofunctionality before transplant and, as regarding skeletal muscles, the potential of generating contractile forces is dependent on the internal fiber organization and is reflected by some macroscopic parameters, such as the spontaneous contraction. Here we propose the application of digital image correlation (DIC) as an independent tool for an accurate and noninvasive measurement of engineered muscle tissue spontaneous contraction. To validate the proposed technique we referred to the X-MET, a promising 3-dimensional model of skeletal muscle. The images acquired through a high speed camera were correlated with a custom-made algorithm and the longitudinal strain predictions were employed for measuring the spontaneous contraction. The spontaneous contraction reference values were obtained by studying the force response. The relative error between the spontaneous contraction frequencies computed in both ways was always lower than 0.15%. In conclusion, the use of a DIC based system allows for an accurate and noninvasive measurement of biological tissues' spontaneous contraction, in addition to the measurement of tissue strain field on any desired region of interest during electrical stimulation.",

KGaA, Weinheim Pain states that arise from non-resolving inflammation, such as inflammatory bowel disease or arthritis, pose an unusually difficult challenge for therapy because of the complexity and heterogeneity of their underlying mechanisms. It has been suggested that key nodes linking interactive pathogenic pathways of non-resolving inflammation might offer novel targets for the treatment of inflammatory pain. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which inhibit the cyclooxygenase (COX)-mediated production of pain- and inflammation-inducing prostanoids, are a common first-line treatment for this condition, but their use is limited by mechanism-based side effects. The endogenous levels of anandamide, an endocannabinoid mediator with analgesic and tissue-protective functions, are regulated by fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH). This review outlines the pharmacological and chemical rationale for the simultaneous inhibition of COX and FAAH activities with designed multitarget agents. Preclinical studies indicate that such agents may combine superior anti-inflammatory efficacy with reduced toxicity.",

A remarkably feature of the OB circuits in rodents is the constitutive integration of new neurons that takes place during adulthood. Newborn cells in the adult OB are mostly inhibitory interneurons belonging to chemically, morphologically and functionally heterogeneous types. Although there is general agreement that adult neurogenesis in the OB plays a key role in sensory information processing and olfaction-related plasticity, the contribution of each interneuron subtype to such functions is far to be elucidated. Here, we focus on the dopaminergic (DA) interneurons: We highlight recent findings about their morphological features and then describe the molecular factors required for the specification/differentiation and maintenance of the DA phenotype in adult born neurons. We also discuss dynamic changes of the DA interneuron population related to age, environmental stimuli and lesions, and their possible functional implications.",

Over 30 million people worldwide are living with dementia and AD prevalence is projected to increase dramatically in the next two decades. In terms of neuropathology, AD is characterized by two major cerebral hallmarks: extracellular β-amyloid (Aβ) plaques and intracellular Tau inclusions, which start accumulating in the brain 15-20 years before the onset of symptoms. Within this context, the scientific community worldwide is undertaking a wide research effort to detect AD pathology at its earliest, before symptoms appear. Neuroimaging of Aβ by positron emission tomography (PET) is clinically available and is a promising modality for early detection of Aβ pathology and AD diagnosis. Substantive efforts are ongoing to develop advanced imaging techniques for early detection of Tau pathology. Here, we will briefly describe the key features of Tau pathology and its heterogeneity across various neurodegenerative diseases bearing cerebral Tau inclusions (i.e., tauopathies). We will outline the current status of research on Tau-specific PET tracers and their clinical development. Finally, we will discuss the potential application of novel super-resolution and label-free techniques for investigating Tau pathology at the experimental level and their potential application for AD diagnosis.

The development of a cost-effective process for the production of mesostructured aluminosilicates, with high Al content and controlled morphology, is highly desired. In this work, mesoporous aluminosilicates, with spherical morphology, have been synthesized under mild acidic aqueous conditions by using an aerosol-assisted sol-gel process, a simple, versatile and potentially scalable method. Two aluminum sources, aluminum isopropoxide and aluminum chloride, have been used, keeping constant the other synthesis and process parameters. FE-SEM, coupled with EDX, TEM and N2 adsorption-desorption measurements have shown that sprayed powders consist of microspheres, homogeneous in size and characterized by high surface areas (up to 640 m2 g-1) and narrow pore size distributions (centred at 2.5 nm). 27Al-NMR spectra of as-synthesized samples have evidenced mostly tetrahedral Al, also for the sample with higher Al content (Si/Al = 5.7). The surface acidity of the sprayed samples has been investigated by FT-IR spectroscopy of adsorbed ammonia and CO, which has shown the presence of Brønsted sites (able to protonate ammonia) and of weak Lewis sites.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 IEEE.A variety of motion planning algorithms has been developed over the past decades. For robotics, the transformation of the problem from the robot Cartesian space (workspace) to the configuration space (C-space) has been crucial - converting the problem of collision-checking between 3D objects to simpler, point-like, tests in the high-dimensional C-space. However, the C-space map-making is both computationally and memory-intensive and the complexity grows with the C-space dimension. With time-varying environments and many robot DoFs, this soon becomes intractable, as newly appearing and possibly moving obstacles need to be remapped online into the high-dimensional C-space. Therefore, we present a fast heuristic planning method designed for a humanoid robot that employs the sampling-based RRT∗ algorithm directly in the Cartesian space and in a hierarchical fashion: first, a collision-free path is planned for the end-effector; second, corresponding collision-free points for every via-point are searched for the robot elbow. The resulting path consists of straight-line segments and is only approximate, but the details - a kinematically feasible smooth trajectory for the robot - is offloaded to an online Cartesian solver and controller that is available on our platform. The results demonstrate, first, that our solution delivers real-time performance (plans faster than 1s on a standard PC) in the vast majority of cases in a significantly cluttered environment. Second, the results are suggestive of the fact that asymptotic optimality of the plans is preserved even for the additional control points. Third, a test of state-of-the-art algorithms on the same scenario shows that solutions cannot be found in reasonable time (less than 10s).",

In this research, we developed a stereo vision system providing qualified point cloud data of the object. A modified and improved iterative closest point algorithm is applied to recognize the targeted object greatly avoiding the local minimum in template matching. Moreover, a stereo vision guided teleoperation control algorithm using virtual fixtures technology is adopted to enhance robot teaching ability. Combining these two functions, the mobile manipulator is able to learn semi-autonomously and work autonomously.

To realize the reactive behaviors, several task space motions, such as the translational motion of the swing foot and the vertical position of the support foot, could be relaxed in presence of obstacles. Therefore, the swing foot trajectory is modulated with respect to the references in real-time for preventing future collisions between the legs, or legs and obstacles in the environment. External obstacle negotiation in the proposed framework can also be addressed generically by treating the obstacle as an extended segment of the support foot. The allowable deviation of the relaxed degrees of freedom from their references could be further utilized to modify the foot placement to regenerate a reactive walking pattern. The validation and the performance of the proposed method are fully evaluated and demonstrated in physics based simulations of the compliant humanoid robot COMAN.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 the authors. The endogenous NMD Areceptor (NMDAR) agonist D-aspartate occurs transiently in the mammalian brain because it is abundant during embryonic and perinatal phases before drastically decreasing during adulthood. It is well established that postnatal reduction of cerebral D-aspartate levels is due to the concomitant onset of D-aspartate oxidase (DDO) activity, a flavoenzyme that selectively degrades bicarboxylic D-amino acids. In the present work, we show that D-aspartate content in the mouse brain drastically decreases after birth, whereas DdomRNAlevels concomitantly increase. Interestingly, postnatal Ddo gene expression is paralleled by progressive demethylation within its putative promoter region. Consistent with an epigenetic control on Ddo expression, treatment with the DNA-demethylating agent, azacitidine, causes increased mRNA levels in embryonic cortical neurons. To indirectly evaluate the effect of a putative persistent Ddo gene hypermethylation in the brain, we used Ddo knock-out mice (Ddo-/-), which show constitutively suppressed Ddo expression. In these mice, we found for the first time substantially increased extracellular content of D-aspartate in the brain. In line with detrimental effects produced by NMDAR overstimulation, persistent elevation of D-aspartate levels in Ddo-/- brains is associated with appearance of dystrophic microglia, precocious caspase-3 activation, and cell death in cortical pyramidal neurons and dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta. This evidence, along with the early accumulation of lipufuscin granules in Ddo-/- brains, highlights an unexpected importance of Ddo demethylation in preventing neurodegenerative processes produced by nonphysiological extracellular levels of free D-aspartate.",

The neurophysiological studies evidenced significant differences in the selected time points corresponding to childhood, young adulthood, adulthood, and aging (i.e., 1, 7, 15, and 25 months of age), with a parabolic course as function of time. The pathological assessment allowed to demonstrate signs of age-related changes since the age of 7 months, with a remarkable increase in both peripheral nerves and dorsal root ganglia at the subsequent time points. These changes were mainly in the myelin sheaths, as also confirmed by the Rotating-Polarization Coherent-Anti-stokes-Raman-scattering microscopy analysis. Evident changes were also present at the morphometric analysis performed on the peripheral nerves, dorsal root ganglia neurons, and skin biopsies.

The new formulation increases the working voltage and induces different electrochemical behavior with respect to bare olivine materials based on Fe. The study provides deep insight into the features of the Fe3+/Fe2+, Mn3+/Mn2+, and Co3+/Co2+ redox couples within the olivine lattice in terms of electrochemical activity, Li+ transport properties, and Li-cell behavior. The electrochemical characterization clearly reveals the voltage signatures corresponding to the various metals; however, the Mn3+/Mn2+ process has higher intrinsic polarization with respect to Fe3+/Fe2+ and Co3+/Co2+. This issue is efficiently mitigated by carbon coating the material, resulting in enhanced electrochemical performances. Tune it up!

In this context, we developed our work on TAAR5 applying a structure-based computational protocol, revolving around homology modeling and virtual screening calculations. In detail, mTAAR5 and hTAAR5 homology models were built, in order to explore any pattern of structural requirements which could be involved in species-specific differences. Successively, the mTAAR5 model was employed to perform a virtual screening of an in-house library of compounds, including different five-membered ring derivatives, linked to a phenyl ring through a flexible or a rigid basic moiety. The computational protocol applied allowed to select a number of chemical scaffolds that were tested in a biological assay leading to the discovery of the first two mTAAR5 antagonists.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 Cattani, Solinas and Canuto. The aim of the present paper is to efficiently describe the membrane potential dynamics of neural populations formed by species having a high density difference in specific brain areas. We propose a hybrid model whose main ingredients are a conductance-based model (ODE system) and its continuous counterpart (PDE system) obtained through a limit process in which the number of neurons confined in a bounded region of the brain tissue is sent to infinity Specifically, in the discrete model, each cell is described by a set of time-dependent variables, whereas in the continuum model, cells are grouped into populations that are described by a set of continuous variables. Communications between populations, which translate into interactions among the discrete and the continuous models, are the essence of the hybrid model we present here. The cerebellum and cerebellum-like structures show in their granular layer a large difference in the relative density of neuronal species making them a natural testing ground for our hybrid model. By reconstructing the ensemble activity of the cerebellar granular layer network and by comparing our results to a more realistic computational network, we demonstrate that our description of the network activity, even though it is not biophysically detailed, is still capable of reproducing salient features of neural network dynamics. Our modeling approach yields a significant computational cost reduction by increasing the simulation speed at least 270 times. The hybrid model reproduces interesting dynamics such as local microcircuit synchronization, traveling waves, center-surround, and time-windowing.",

Background: Exercise intolerance is one of the main clinical symptoms of heart failure (HF) and is associated with skeletal muscle wasting due to an imbalance between proteolysis and protein synthesis. In this study, we tested whether aerobic exercise training (AET) would counteract skeletal muscle atrophy by activating IGF-I/Akt/mTOR pathway in HF mice. Methods: Sympathetic hyperactivity induced HF mice were assigned into 8-week moderate intensity AET. Untrained wild type and HF mice were used as control. Soleus cross sectional area was evaluated by histochemistry and motor performance by rotarod. 26S proteasome activity was assessed by fluorimetric assay, and components of IGF-I/Akt/mTOR pathway or myostatin pathway by qRT-PCR or immunoblotting. A different subset of mice was used to evaluate the relative contribution of mTOR inhibition (rapamycin) or activation (leucine) on AET-induced changes in muscle mass regulation. Results: AET prevented exercise intolerance and impaired motor performance in HF mice. These effects were associated with attenuation of soleus atrophy. Rapamycin treatment precluded AET effects on soleus mass in HF mice suggesting the involvement of IGF signaling pathway in this response. In fact, AET increased IGF-I Ea and IGF-I Pan mRNA levels, while it reduced myostatin and Smad2 mRNA levels in HF mice. At protein levels, AET prevented reduced expression levels of IGF-I, pAkt (at basal state), as well as, p4E-BP1 and pP70S6K (leucine-stimulated state) in HF mice. Additionally, AET prevented 26S proteasome hyperactivity in HF mice. Conclusions: Taken together, our data provide evidence for AET-induced activation of IGF-I/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway counteracting HF-induced muscle wasting.",

Here, we show the combined use of two naturally derived compounds, sodium alginate and lavender essential oil, for the production of bioactive nanofibrous dressings by electrospinning, and their efficacy for the treatment of skin burns induced by midrange ultraviolet radiation (UVB). We demonstrate that the engineered dressings reduce the risk of microbial infection of the burn, since they stop the growth of Staphylococcus aureus. Furthermore, they are able to control and reduce the inflammatory response that is induced in human foreskin fibroblasts by lipopolysaccharides, and in rodents by UVB exposure. In particular, we report a remarkable reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines when fibroblasts or animals are treated with the alginate-based nanofibers. The down-regulation of cytokines production and the absence of erythema on the skin of the treated animals confirm that the here described dressings are promising as advanced biomedical devices for burn management.",

In parallel, essential oils are having continuous growth in biomedical applications due to the inherent active compounds that they contain. A characteristic example is lemongrass oil that has exceptional antimicrobial properties. In this work, nanocapsules of cellulose acetate with lemongrass oil were developed with the solvent/anti-solvent method with resulting diameter tailored between 95 and 185 nm. Various physico-chemical and surface analysis techniques were employed to investigate the formation of the nanocapsules.

Flexible devices integrating thin films with controlled residual stress have been realized on polyimide substrate to obtain a pre-stressed structure (PSS). These devices show an enhancement of the generated output voltage, if compared to a flat-shape structure, when subjected to a deformation: the piezoelectric skin undergoing folding /unfolding states exhibits fast snapping transitions due to the buckling effect, which increases the mechanical stress of the piezoelectric structure, improving the generated output voltage. Experimental results demonstrate a maximum peak-to-peak voltage of 0.7 V for a PSS, about six times higher than the corresponding voltage obtained for flat structures.

By general consensus, the latter organism belonged to α proteobacteria, subsequently evolving into the mitochondrial organelle of our cells. The consensus is based upon genetic and metabolic similarities between mitochondria and aerobic α proteobacteria but fails to explain the origin of several enzymes found in the mitochondria-derived organelles of anaerobic eukaryotes such as Trichomonas and Entamoeba. These enzymes are thought to derive from bacterial lineages other than α proteobacteria, e.g., Clostridium - an obligate anaerobe. [FeFe]-hydrogenase constitues the characteristic enzyme of this anaerobic metabolism and is present in different types also in Entamoeba and other anaerobic eukaryotes. Here we show that α proteobacteria derived from metagenomic studies possess both the cytosolic and organellar type of [FeFe]-hydrogenase, as well as all the proteins required for hydrogenase maturation. These organisms are related to cultivated members of the Rhodospirillales order previously suggested to be close relatives of mitochondrial ancestors. For the first time, our evidence supports an α proteobacterial ancestry for both the anaerobic and the aerobic metabolism of eukaryotes.

            "abstract": "© 2015 American Psychological Association. A growing body of work suggests that in some circumstances, humans may be capable of ascribing mental states to others in a way that is fast, cognitively efficient, and implicit (implicit mentalizing hypothesis). However, the interpretation of this work has recently been challenged by suggesting that the observed effects may reflect \"submentalizing\" effects of attention and memory, with no ascription of mental states (submentalizing hypothesis). The present study employed a strong test between these hypotheses by examining whether apparently automatic processing of another's visual perspective is influenced by experience-dependent beliefs about whether that person can see. Altercentric interference was observed when participants judged their own perspective on stimuli involving an avatar wearing goggles that participants believed to be transparent but not when they believed the goggles to be opaque. These results are consistent with participants ascribing mental states to the avatar and not with the submentalizing hypothesis that altercentric interference arises merely because avatars cue shifts in spatial attention.",

            "abstract": "© 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. Agenesis of the corpus callosum (AgCC) is a congenital condition associated with wide-ranging emotional and social impairments often overlapping with the diagnostic criteria for autism. Mapping functional connectivity in the acallosal brain can help identify neural correlates of the deficits associated with this condition, and elucidate how congenital white matter alterations shape the topology of large-scale functional networks. By using resting-state BOLD functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI), here we show that acallosal BTBR T+tpr3tf/J (BTBR) mice, an idiopathic model of autism, exhibit impaired intra-hemispheric connectivity in fronto-cortical, but not in posterior sensory cortical areas. We also document profoundly altered subcortical and intra-hemispheric connectivity networks, with evidence of marked fronto-thalamic and striatal disconnectivity, along with aberrant spatial extension and strength of ipsilateral and local connectivity. Importantly, inter-hemispheric tracing of monosynaptic connections in the primary visual cortex using recombinant rabies virus confirmed the absence of direct homotopic pathways between posterior cortical areas of BTBR mice, suggesting a polysynaptic origin for the synchronous rsfMRI signal observed in these regions. Collectively, the observed long-range connectivity impairments recapitulate hallmark neuroimaging findings in autism, and are consistent with the behavioral phenotype of BTBR mice. In contrast to recent rsfMRI studies in high functioning AgCC individuals, the profound fronto-cortical and subcortical disconnectivity mapped suggest that compensatory mechanism may not necessarily restore the full connectional topology of the brain, resulting in residual connectivity alterations that serve as plausible substrates for the cognitive and emotional deficits often associated with AgCC.",

Recent advancements in imaging diagnostics have focused on the use of nanostructures that entrap Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Contrast Agents (CAs), without the need to chemically modify the clinically approved compounds. Nevertheless, the exploitation of microfluidic platforms for their controlled and continuous production is still missing. Here, a microfluidic platform is used to synthesize crosslinked Hyaluronic Acid NanoParticles (cHANPs) in which a clinically relevant MRI-CAs, gadolinium diethylenetriamine penta-acetic acid (Gd-DTPA), is entrapped. This microfluidic process facilitates a high degree of control over particle synthesis, enabling the production of monodisperse particles as small as 35 nm. Furthermore, the interference of Gd-DTPA during polymer precipitation is overcome by finely tuning process parameters and leveraging the use of hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) of surfactants and pH conditions. For both production strategies proposed to design Gd-loaded cHANPs, a boosting of the relaxation rate T1 is observed since a T1 of 1562 is achieved with a 10 μM of Gd-loaded cHANPs while a similar value is reached with 100 μM of the relevant clinical Gd-DTPA in solution. The advanced microfluidic platform to synthesize intravascularly-injectable and completely biocompatible hydrogel nanoparticles entrapping clinically approved CAs enables the implementation of straightforward and scalable strategies in diagnostics and therapy applications.",

The interface between the blood pool and the extravascular matrix is fundamental in regulating the transport of molecules, nanoparticles and cells under physiological and pathological conditions. In this work, a microfluidic chip is presented comprising two parallel microchannels connected laterally via an array of high aspect ratio micropillars, constituting the permeable vascular membrane. A double-step lithographic process combined with a replica molding approach is employed to realize 80 different arrays of micropillars exhibiting three cross-sectional geometries (rectangular, elliptical and curved); two orientations (normal and parallel) with respect to the flow; and a variety of width and gap sizes, respectively, ranging from 10 to 20 μm and 2 to 5 μm. As compared to conventional rectangular structures, the curved pillars provide higher bending stiffness, lower adhesive interactions, and smaller intra-channel separation distances. Specifically, 10-μm-wide curved pillars, laying parallel to the flow, offered the highest mechanical stability. To assess vascular permeability, the extravascular channel was filled with a hyaluronic acid hydrogel, while fluorescent Dextran molecules and calibrated polystyrene beads were injected in the vascular channel. Membrane permeability was observed to reduce with the molecular weight of Dextran and diameter of the beads, ranging from about 6 × 10−5 to 2 × 10−5 cm/s for 40 and 250 kDa Dextran and up to zero for 1.5 μm beads. The presented data demonstrate the potential of the proposed microfluidic chip for analyzing the vascular and extravascular mass transport, over multiple spatial and temporal scales, in a variety of diseases involving differential permeation across vascular walls.",

Tissue-on-chip (TOC) systems aim at replicating complex biological dynamics in vitro with the potential either to improve the understanding of human biology or to develop more accurate therapeutic strategies. To replicate faithfully the intricate interrelationships between cells and their surrounding microenvironment, the three-dimensional (3D) tissue model must possess a responsive extracellular matrix (ECM). ECM remodeling plays a pivotal role in guiding cells and tissues functions and such aspect is somewhat denied during in vitro studies. For this purpose, we fabricated a micro-perfusion bioreactor capable to sustain the viability of 3D engineered tissue models recapitulating the process of the native ECM deposition and assembly. Engineered human dermis micro-tissue precursors (HD-μTP) were used as building blocks to generate a final tissue. HD-μTP were loaded in the perfusion space of the micro-perfusion bioreactor and, under the superimposition of different fluid dynamic regimes and biochemical stimulation, they synthesized new collagen proteins that were, then, assembled in the perfusion space forming a continuum of cells embedded in their own ECM. The micro-perfusion bioreactor was fabricated to allow the on-line monitoring of the oxygen consumption and the assembly of the newly formed collagen network via real time acquisition of the second harmonic generation (SHG) signal.

One of the most efficient techniques to enhance this uptake is reversible electroporation. Nevertheless, the detailed molecular mechanism of transport of chemical species (dyes, drugs, genetic materials, …) following the application of electric pulses is not yet fully elucidated. In the past decade, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been conducted to model the effect of pulsed electric fields on membranes, describing several aspects of this phenomenon. Here, we first present a comprehensive review of the results obtained so far modeling the electroporation of lipid membranes, then we extend these findings to study the electrotransfer across lipid bilayers subject to microsecond pulsed electric fields of Tat11, a small hydrophilic charged peptide, and of siRNA. We use in particular a MD simulation protocol that allows to characterize the transport of charged species through stable pores. Unexpectedly, our results show that for an electroporated bilayer subject to transmembrane voltages in the order of 500 mV, i.e. consistent with experimental conditions, both Tat11 and siRNA can translocate through nanoelectropores within tens of ns. We discuss these results in comparison to experiments in order to rationalize the mechanism of drug uptake by cells.

Namely, hand posture reconstruction employs Knitted Piezoresistive Fabrics that allows us to measure bending. From only five of these sensors (one for each finger) the full hand pose of a 19 degrees of freedom (DOF) hand model is reconstructed leveraging optimal sensor placement and estimation techniques. To this end, we exploit a-priori information of synergistic coordination patterns in grasping tasks. Tactile sensing employs a piezoresistive fabric allowing us to measure normal forces in more than 50 taxels spread over the palmar surface of the glove. We describe both sensing technologies, report on the software integration of both modalities, and describe a preliminary evaluation experiment analyzing hand postures and force patterns during grasping. Results of the reconstruction are promising and encourage us to push further our approach with potential applications in neuroscience, virtual reality, robotics and tele-operation.",

KGaA, Weinheim.A multifunctional, semitransparent photovoltaic device is proposed for harvesting sunlight over a tunable spectral range extending from the UV to the IR. Self-assembled monolayers of nanospheres applied to luminescent concentrators provide a photon management architecture, which relies on luminescence and diffraction of light. The light diffraction is tuned by changing the sphere diameter to match the transparency region of the fluorophores. The importance of each optical mechanism is inferred from a systematic experimental investigation of the external quantum efficiency of fabricated devices, and from the calculation of the resulting photocurrent under the AM 1.5 solar spectrum. Compared to the conventional luminescent concentrator, relative photocurrent improvements are shown between 50% and 500% depending on the spectral properties of the device components. It has been demonstrated how to tailor the photovoltaic performances, the color and the degree of transparency of the device to provide a versatile photovoltaic unit for sustainable building-integrated applications.",

The Micro-for-Nano (M4N) chip integrates on top of the electronics an array of aluminummicroelectrodes covered with gold by means of a customized electroless plating process. The NW assembly process is driven by an array of on-chip dielectrophoresis (DEP) generators, enabling a custom layout of different nanosensors on the same microelectrode array. The electrical properties of each assembled NW are singularly sensed through an in situ CMOS read-out circuit (ROC) that guarantees a low noise and reliable measurement. The M4N chip is directly connected to an external microcontroller for configuration and data processing. The processed data are then redirected to a workstation for real-time data visualization and storage during sensing experiments. As proof of concept, ZnO nanowires have been integrated onto the M4N chip to validate the approach that enables different kind of sensing experiments. The device has been then irradiated by an external UV source with adjustable power to measure the ZnO sensitivity to UV-light exposure. A maximum variation of about 80% of the ZnO-NW resistance has been detected by the M4N system when the assembled 5 µm × 500nm single ZnO-NW is exposed to an estimated incident radiant UV-light flux in the range of 1nW-229nW. The performed experiments prove the efficiency of the platform conceived for exploiting any kind of material that can change its capacitance and/or resistance due to an external stimulus.",

The system incorporates an active pressure control unit with on-off solenoid valves that permit the regulation of the air pressure of the protection chamber. The impact protection system is smaller and lighter than a rubber-based passive protection previously mounted on the hands, while it offers better impact reduction performance via fast and accurate pressure control.

The environment is perceived with a stereo camera system and then simplified into a set of environmental primitives. Based on these primitives the interface proposes affordances to the pilot. Affordances are represented as certainty functions over the space of end-effector poses. The pilot operates the robot by selecting among proposed affordances and related action primitives, i.e. Object-Action Complexes (OACs). Before initiating execution, the pilot can review and revise the parameterization of the scheduled action primitive in a 3D reconstruction of the environment. The pilot interface proposed in this work has been implemented and evaluated on the humanoid robot WALK-MAN. With this work we also demonstrate the transferability of the perceptual concept, as our previous experiments have been performed using the humanoid robot ARMAR-III.",

Despite several advances in molecular biology and diagnostics, Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) is currently the gold standard for nucleic acids amplification and detection, due to its versatility, low-cost and universality, with estimated &lt;10 billion reactions per year and a worldwide market of several billion dollars/year. Nevertheless, PCR still relies on the laborious, time-consuming, and multi-step gel electrophoresis-based detection, which includes gel casting, electrophoretic run, gel staining, and gel visualization. In this work, we propose a \"PCR developer\", namely a universal one-step, one-tube method, based on controlled aggregation of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), to detect PCR products by naked eye in few minutes, with no need for any instrumentation. We demonstrated the specificity and sensitivity of the PCR developer on different model targets, suitable for a qualitative detection in real-world diagnostics (i.e., gene rearrangements, genetically modified organisms, and pathogens). The PCR developer proved to be highly specific and ultra-sensitive, discriminating down to few copies of HIV viral DNA, diluted in an excess of interfering human genomic DNA, which is a clinically relevant viral load. Hence, it could be a valuable tool for both academic research and clinical applications.",

In the present work, the corrosion resistance in chloride solutions of a AISMOMg alloy obtained by \"Direct Metal Laser Sintering\" (DMLS) process was evaluated. The alloy was studied by means of anodic potentiodynamic tests considering two superficial conditions: with the rough surface as produced by the DMLS technology or after mechanical polishing and passivation in air. The results show the effect of the surface conditions deriving from the production process and the microstructure. A worsening of the resistance to the localized corrosion was observed for the alloy in the \"as produced\" conditions, with decrease of the pitting potential and increment of passive current density compared to the polished and air passivated surface. The difference in the behavior becomes negligible with the increase of chlorides concentration. The initiation of corrosion takes place by the selective dissolution of the a-AI phase at the edge of the melting pool, stimulated by nobler precipitates, especially silicon based. A main role of chloride concentration in the initiation of localized corrosion was confirmed, whereas the pH solution doesn't seem to produce relevant effects in the interval considered for testing.",

Here, we discuss an important analogy between two widely different physical problems, namely, the Jahn–Teller distortion in molecular physics and the Rashba spin splitting in condensed matter physics. By exploring their conceptual and mathematical features and by searching for the counterparts between them, we examine the orbital texture in Jahn–Teller systems, as the counterpart of the spin texture of the Rashba physics, and put forward a possible way of experimentally detecting the orbital texture. Finally, we discuss the analogy by comparing the coexistence of linear Rashba + Dresselhaus effects and Jahn–Teller problems for specific symmetries, which allow for nontrivial spin and orbital textures, respectively.",

We consider the infusion of a diluted suspension of nanoparticles (NPs) into poroelastic brain tissue, in view of relevant biomedical applications such as intratumoral thermotherapy. Indeed, the high impact of the related pathologies motivates the development of advanced therapeutic approaches, whose design also benefits from theoretical models.This study provides an analytical expression for the time-dependent NPs concentration during the infusion into poroelastic brain tissue, which also accounts for particle binding onto cells (by recalling relevant results from the colloid filtration theory). Our model is computationally inexpensive and, compared to fully numerical approaches, permits to explicitly elucidate the role of the involved physical aspects (tissue poroelasticity, infusion parameters, NPs physico-chemical properties, NP-tissue interactions underlying binding). We also present illustrative results based on parameters taken from the literature, by considering clinically relevant ranges for the infusion parameters. Moreover, we thoroughly assess the model working assumptions besides discussing its limitations.While not laying any claims of generality, our model can be used to support the development of more ambitious numerical approaches, towards the preliminary design of novel therapies based on NPs infusion into brain tissue.",

Pyromellitic dianhydride-4,4-oxydianiline (PMDA-ODA), broadly known as Kapton, is investigated for detection and quantification of ammonia (NH3) vapors from ammonia solutions of different molarities. The PMDA-ODA films are made by solution casting on microscope glass slides and cured at 200 °C. Ammonia sensing is performed by measuring the changes in the electric current intensity under ambient conditions of temperature and humidity. The sensor exhibits fast response to ammonia vapors, for aqueous ammonia solutions with molarity as low as 3.5 mM. The adsorption processes of ammonia to the polyimide surface after exposure to ammonia vapors are investigated by FTIR and XPS, revealing that ammonia results in the disruption of imide linkages and the simultaneous creation of amides I and II. Control experiments performed on commercial Kapton adhesive tape show negligible sensitivity of the commercial product to ammonia vapors from different ammonia solution molarities. A device is also presented, demonstrating the real-time detection of ammonia vapors.",

The supernumerary robotic fingers are a recently introduced class of wearable robotics that provides users additional robotic limbs in order to compensate or augment the existing abilities of natural limbs without substituting them. Since supernumerary robotic fingers are supposed to closely interact and perform actions in synergy with the human limbs, the control principles of extra finger should have similar behavior as human's ones including the ability of regulating the compliance. So that, it is important to propose a control interface and to consider the actuators and sensing capabilities of the robotic extra finger compatible to implement stiffness regulation control techniques. We propose EMG interface and a control approach to regulate the compliance of the device through servo actuators. In particular, we use a commercial EMG armband for gesture recognition to be associated with the motion control of the robotic device and surface one channel EMG electrodes interface to regulate the compliance of the robotic device. We also present an updated version of a robotic extra finger where the adduction/abduction motion is realized through ball bearing and spur gears mechanism. We have validated the proposed interface with two sets of experiments related to compensation and augmentation. In the first set of experiments, different bimanual tasks have been performed with the help of the robotic device and simulating a paretic hand since this novel wearable system can be used to compensate the missing grasping abilities in chronic stroke patients. In the second set, the robotic extra finger is used to enlarge the workspace and manipulation capability of healthy hands. In both sets, the same EMG control interface has been used. The obtained results demonstrate that the proposed control interface is intuitive and can successfully be used, not only to control the motion of a supernumerary robotic finger but also to regulate its compliance. The proposed approach can be exploited also for the control of different wearable devices that has to actively cooperate with the human limbs.",

KGaA, Weinheim In this work, a new model of breast cancer is proposed featuring both epithelial and stromal tissues arranged on a microfluidic chip. The main task of the work is the in vitro replication of the stromal activation during tumor epithelial invasion. The activation of tumor stroma and its morphological/compositional changes play a key role in tumor progression. Despite emerging evidences, to date the activation of tumor stroma in vitro has not been achieved yet. The tumor-on-chip proposed in this work is built in order to replicate the features of its native counterpart: multicellularity (tumor epithelial cell and stromal cell); 3D engineered stroma compartment composed of cell-assembled extracellular matrix (ECM); reliable 3D tumor architecture. During tumor epithelial invasion the stroma displayed an activation process at both cellular and ECM level. Similarly of what repeated in vivo, ECM remodeling is found in terms of hyaluronic acid and fibronectin overexpression in the stroma compartment. Furthermore, the cell-assembled ECM featuring the stromal tissue, allowed on-line monitoring of collagen remodeling during stroma activation process via real time multiphoton microscopy. Also, trafficking of macromolecules within the stromal compartment has been monitored in real time.",

Lipoprotein synthesis is controlled by estrogens, but the exact mechanisms underpinning this regulation and the role of the hepatic estrogen receptor α (ERα) in cholesterol physiology are unclear. Utilizing a mouse model involving selective ablation of ERα in the liver, we demonstrate that hepatic ERα couples lipid metabolism to the reproductive cycle. We show that this receptor regulates the synthesis of cholesterol transport proteins, enzymes for lipoprotein remodeling, and receptors for cholesterol uptake. Additionally, ERα is indispensable during proestrus for the generation of high-density lipoproteins efficient in eliciting cholesterol efflux from macrophages. We propose that a specific interaction with liver X receptor α (LXRα) mediates the broad effects of ERα on the hepatic lipid metabolism.",

            "abstract": "© Springer International Publishing AG 2016. Approaches inspired by Newtonian mechanics have been successfully applied for detecting abnormal behaviors in crowd scenarios, being the most notable example the Social Force Model (SFM). This class of approaches describes the movements and local interactions among individuals in crowds by means of repulsive and attractive forces. Despite their promising performance, recent socio-psychology studies have shown that current SFM-based methods may not be capable of explaining behaviors in complex crowd scenarios. An alternative approach consists in describing the cognitive processes that gives rise to the behavioral patterns observed in crowd using heuristics. Inspired by these studies, we propose a new hybrid framework to detect violent events in crowd videos. More specifically, (i) we define a set of simple behavioral heuristics to describe people behaviors in crowd, and (ii) we implement these heuristics into physical equations, being able to model and classify such behaviors in the videos. The resulting heuristic maps are used to extract video features to distinguish violence from normal events. Our violence detection results set the new state of the art on several standard benchmarks and demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to standard motion descriptors, previous physics-inspired models used for crowd analysis and pre-trained ConvNet for crowd behavior analysis.",

            "abstract": "Copyright © 2016 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics. The endogenous lipid amides, palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) and oleoylethanolamide (OEA), exert marked antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory effects in animal models by engaging nuclear peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-a. PEA and OEA are produced by macrophages and other host-defense cells and are deactivated by the cysteine amidase, N-acylethanolamine acid amidase (NAAA), which is highly expressed in macrophages and B-lymphocytes. In the present study, we examined whether a) NAAA might be involved in the inflammatory reaction triggered by injection of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) into the rat paw and b) administration of 4-cyclohexylbutyl-N-[(S)-2-oxoazetidin- 3-yl]-carbamate (ARN726), a novel systemically active NAAA inhibitor, attenuates such reaction. Injection of CFA into the paw produced local edema and heat hyperalgesia, which were accompanied by decreased PEA and OEA content (assessed by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry) and increased NAAA levels (assessed by Western blot and ex vivo enzyme activity measurements) in paw tissue. Administration of undec- 10-ynyl-N-[(3S)-2-oxoazetidin-3-yl] carbamate (ARN14686), a NAAA-preferring activity-based probe, revealed that NAAA was catalytically active in CFA-treated paws. Administration of ARN726 reduced NAAA activity and restored PEA and OEA levels in inflamed tissues, and significantly decreased CFAinduced inflammatory symptoms, including pus production and myeloperoxidase activity. The results confirm the usefulness of ARN726 as a probe to investigate the functions of NAAA in health and disease and suggest that this enzyme may provide a new molecular target for the treatment of arthritis.",

The recent optical sensor is composed of an optical fiber source made up of a nanocomposite material, and it allows detecting the characteristics of the target by monitoring the backscattered light. The innovative tool here presented is based on the analysis of several experiments carried out, considering small notches of different lengths.

The development of the β- based radio-guided surgery aims to extend the technique to those tumours where surgery is the only possible treatment and the assessment of the resection would most profit from the low background around the lesion, as for brain tumours.

In such tests particular care has to be taken to reproduce the surgical field conditions. The tests showed that the prototype under study has 70% efficiency on electrons with an energy threshold at 540 keV, a point-like resolution of 2.8±0.1 mm, and a sensitivity to photons lower than 1%. The tests also demonstrated, with an innovative technique to produce specific phantoms, that 0.5 ml residuals can be safely identified in 1 s with tumor-non-tumor ratio equal to 10.",

In this paper we propose a rationalization of experiments based on first-principles calculations of optical and electrical properties of oxygen-deficient (reduced) WO3. Our approach is based on a parameter-free dielectric-dependent hybrid density functional methodology, used in combination with the charge transition levels formalism, for studying excitation mechanisms in the presence of defects. Our results indicate that oxygen vacancies lead to a different physics in γ-monoclinic WO3, depending on the orientation of the W-O-W chain where the vacancy is created, thus evidencing strong anisotropic effects rooted in the peculiar structural properties of the original nondefective monoclinic cell. Different types of oxygen vacancies can hence be classified on the basis of the calculated ground state properties, electronic structure, and excitation/emission energies, giving a satisfactory explanation to a range of experimental observations made on oxygen-deficient WO3.",

First proposed more than 20 years ago, dye-sensitized solar cells represent one of the most interesting non-silicon solar harvesters, with outstanding potential as low-cost devices wiTheasy fabrication process. Their standard architecture is constituted by a dye-sensitized TiO2 nanoparticle-based photoanode, a hole-conducting liquid electrolyte and a platinized counter electrode. Even if nanoparticles offer a high number of sites for dye molecule chemisorption, they exhibit limited transport and recombination properties with respect to 1D nanostructures such as nanowires or nanotubes. In view of increasing the dye-sensitized solar cell conversion efficiency, new one-dimensional metal-oxide nanostructures are suggested to be employed as photoanodes. In this chapter the fabrication and characterization of free-standing TiO2 nanotube membranes and their integration in front-side illuminated dye-sensitized solar cells are reported. Vertically oriented TiO2 nanotube arrays are fabricated by anodic oxidation, a simple electrochemical technique. The charge transport and recombination mechanisms in the oxide nanostructures are studied by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The first part of the chapter is devoted to describe the dye-sensitized solar cell working principles, the anodic oxidation process, and the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements. In the second part the TiO2 nanotube membrane fabrication and the results obtained on dye-sensitized solar cells are presented, showing the effectiveness of the use of 1D nanostructures as photoanode materials.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 The Author(s). Background: Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant brain tumor in children. To date only few cases of medulloblastoma with hemorrhages have been reported in the literature. Although some studies speculate on the pathogenesis of this anomalous increased vascularization in medulloblastoma, the specific mechanism is still far from clearly understood. A correlation between molecular medulloblastoma subgroups and hemorrhagic features has not been reported, although recent preliminary studies described that WNT-subtype tumors display increased vascularization and hemorrhaging. Case presentation: Herein, we describe a child with a Wnt-medulloblastoma presenting as cerebellar-vermian hemorrhagic lesion. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed the presence of a midline posterior fossa mass with a cystic hemorrhagic component. The differential diagnosis based on imaging included cavernous hemangioma, arteriovenous malformation and traumatic lesion. At surgery, the tumor appeared richly vascularized as documented by the preoperative angiography. Conclusions: The case we present showed that Wnt medulloblastoma may be associated with anomalous vascularization. Further studies are needed to elucidate if there is a link between the hypervascularization and the Wnt/β-catenin signaling activation and if this abnormal vasculature might influence drug penetration contributing to good prognosis of this medulloblastoma subgroup.",

Motor brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) transform neural activities recorded directly from the brain into motor commands to control the movements of an external object by establishing an interface between the central nervous system (CNS) and the device. Bidirectional BMIs are closed-loop systems that add a sensory channel to provide the brain with an artificial feedback signal produced by the interaction between the device and the external world. Taking inspiration from the functioning of the spinal cord in mammalians, in our previous works we designed and developed a bidirectional BMI that uses the neural signals recorded form rats' motor cortex to control the movement of an external object. We implemented a decoding interface based on the approximation of a predefined force field with a central attractor point. Now we consider a non-linear transformation that allows to design a decoder approximating force fields with arbitrary attractors. We describe here the non-linear mapping algorithm and preliminary results of its use with behaving rats.",

The most widely used neuropsychological tests for the evaluation of attentional set-shifting in human subjects are the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) and the CANTAB Intra-/Extra-dimensional set shift task (ID/ED). These tasks have proven clinical relevance and have been modified and successfully adapted for research in animal models. However, currently available tasks for rodents present several limitations, mainly due to their manual-based testing procedures, which are hampering translational advances in psychiatric medicine. To overcome these limitations and to better mimic the original version in primates, we present the development of a novel operant-based two- chamber ID/ED “Operon” task for rodents. We demonstrated the effectiveness of this novel task to measure different facets of cognitive flexibility in mice including attentional set formation and shifting, and reversal learning. Moreover, we show the high flexibility of this task in which three different perceptual dimensions can be manipulated with a high number of stimuli cues for each dimension. This novel ID/ED Operon task can be an effective preclinical tool for drug testing and/or large genetic screening relevant to the study of executive dysfunction and cognitive symptoms found in psychiatric disorders.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 IEEE.This paper addresses tactile object recognition, i.e. the identification of an object among a set of known objects, given tactile measurements. The solution of this problem can improve perception capabilities of autonomous robots and complement vision. Such a system is fundamental for the operation of autonomous robots that are often required to recognize objects while interacting with the environment. The proposed approach is innovative for three reasons. First, tactile recognition is cast into a tactile localization problem wherein multiple models are fit to the available measurements and objects are recognized by selecting the model that minimizes the localization error. Second, the measurements consist only of 3D contact point coordinates, which provide poor information for the recognition task. Lastly, we make use of a novel and effective filtering algorithm, named Memory Unscented Particle Filter (MUPF), which solves the 6 degree-of-freedom localization (and recognition) problem recursively by using only contact point measurements. The performance of the proposed approach has been assessed both in simulation and on a real robotic system equipped with tactile sensors (i.e., the iCub humanoid robot). The experiments show that our approach provides good recognition performance and is able to discriminate objects that are similar even in presence of noisy measurements.",

The realization of biologically relevant human tissue equivalents as an in vitro model to investigate human diseases, as well as to test the efficacy or toxicity of novel compounds, is emerging as a new challenge in tissue engineering. Currently, the in vitro three-dimensional (3D) dermis model mainly involves the use of cells embedded in exogenous non-human matrices. However, such models feature biological and functional disparities with native dermis, therefore limiting their relevance to the in vivo situation. The purpose of this study was to provide a reliable endogenous human dermal equivalent (HDE) able to recapitulate the extracellular matrix (ECM) remodelling of the native dermis occurring after external damage. To this end, UVA irradiation was used to induce photodamage to both the HDE and to a fibroblast-populated collagen matrix. The photodamage was investigated at the cellular and ECM level and the results showed that, although a cellular response was detected in both systems, no ECM reorganization characteristic of the in vivo photo-aged dermis could be detected in the fibroblast-populated collagen matrix. In contrast in the HDE, the neosynthesized ECM recapitulated the characteristic ageing behaviour of the dermis found in vivo, in terms of collagen and hyaluronic acid synthesis as well as collagen organization remodelling. This study therefore demonstrates the role of the endogenous ECM in recapitulating in vitro the functionality of the human dermis and the proposed HDE as a novel tool for photoprotection trials.",

This paper introduces a novel design of membraneless microfluidic biofuel cell that incorporates three-dimensional porous electrodes containing immobilized enzymes to catalyze redox reactions occurring in the presence of ethanol/O2 co-laminar flows. In order to maximize the penetration depth of the reactants inside the porous medium, we report on the preliminary evaluation of cantilevered bioelectrodes, namely the fibrous electrodes protrude along the internal walls of the miniature electrochemical chamber. As a first proof-of-concept, we demonstrate the integration of a bioanode and a biocathode into a lamination-based microfluidic cell fabricated via rapid prototyping. With enzymes deposited into the fibrous structure of 25 mm long, 1 mm wide and 0.11 mm thick carbon paper electrodes, the volumetric power density reached 1.25 mW cm-3 at 0.43 V under a flow rate of 50 μL min-1. An advantage of the presented microfluidic biofuel cell is that it can be adapted to include a larger active electrode volume via the vertical stacking of multiple thin bioelectrodes. We therefore envision that our design would be amenable to reach the level of net power required to supply energy to a plurality of low-consumption electronic devices.",

In this work a hybrid graphene-based flexible micro-supercapacitor (MSC) exploiting a novel composite material was fabricated and extensively characterized. TheMSCelectrodes have been obtained from a synthesized composite aerogel of reduced graphene oxide and polycrystalline nanoparticles of molybdenum (IV) oxide (MoO2) and then dispersed in a solution containing poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT). Usually in MSCs the electrons have to percolate through the nanostructured Three-dimensional (3D) matrix in order to reach the collectors, made by metal thin films that provide electrical contacts only on the surface of active material. In the attempt to enable a more efficient charge transfer and to allow direct electrical contact without metal deposition, in this study a highly doped PEDOT acting both as current collector and as binder for the nanocomposite material has been employed. 3D MSCs were fabricated through a Lithographie, Galvanoformung, Abformung (LIGA)-like process to obtain high aspect ratio microstructures in polydimethylsiloxane replicas. Capacitance values of 94 F g1 for the nanocomposite and of 14 mF cm-2 for the device were achieved. Moreover, bending test has demonstrated good performance preservation in aUshape conformation of the device.",

This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited. Several genetic conditions can lead to left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). Among them, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), caused by mutations in sarcomere genes, is the most common inherited cardiac disease. Instead, RASopathies, a rare class of disorders characterized by neuro-cardio-facial-cutaneous abnormalities and sometimes presenting with LVH, are caused by mutations in the RAS-MAPK pathway. We report on a 62-years-old male who presented isolated severe obstructive LVH but did not carry the sarcomere mutation previously identified in his affected relatives. By exome sequencing, we detected a novel mutation in HRAS gene (NM-005343.2:p.Arg68Trp), present also in the proband's daughter, who showed mild LVH and severe intellectual disability. The cardiac phenotype was indistinguishable between family members carrying either mutation. In silico studies suggested that the mutated HRAS protein is constitutionally activated. Consistently, functional characterization in vitro confirmed elevated HRAS-GTP accumulation and downstream RAS-MAPK pathway activation that are known to drive cell proliferation in LVH. Our study emphasizes the role of RAS signaling in cardiac hypertrophy and highlights the complexity in differential diagnosis of RASopathies. In fact, the mild features of RASopathy and the recurrence of sarcomeric HCM in this family delayed the correct diagnosis until comprehensive genetic testing was performed.",

In this work, a novel surface coating technique, namely pulsed laser deposition (PLD), along with a high-energy mechanical milling (MM) methods were used to deposit well-bonded TiC coatings on a titanium grade (II) substrate. For this reason, TiC particles were coated on titanium plates, with and without PLD layer, using ball milling process at different conditions. The effects of mechanical milling parameters, such as milling time and rotation speed, as well as the effect of PLD have been investigated. The microstructure of coated samples was studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Chemical composition was analyzed by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). Microhardness and scratch tests were carried out to examine the mechanical and adhesion properties of the coatings, respectively. The coated surface SEM images showed that the dense TiC coating with strong bonding to the substrate could be achieved by using a combination of mechanical milling (MM) and pulsed laser deposition (PLD) techniques. In addition, a possible mechanism was proposed for the formation of TiC coatings during mechanical milling on the PLD-TiC coated substrate. Finally, it was observed that combination of PLD and MM methods (PLD + MM) can produce well-bonded coatings with extraordinary properties, compared to just mechanical milling method.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc. Proline-rich transmembrane protein 2 (PRRT2) has been identified as the single causative gene for a group of paroxysmal syndromes of infancy, including epilepsy, paroxysmal movement disorders, and migraine. On the basis of topology predictions, PRRT2 has been assigned to the recently characterized family of Dispanins, whose members share the two-transmembrane domain topology with a large N terminus and short C terminus oriented toward the outside of the cell. Because PRRT2 plays a role at the synapse, it is important to confirm the exact orientation of its N and C termini with respect to the plasma membrane to get clues regarding its possible function. Using a combination of different experimental approaches, including live immunolabeling, immunogold electron microscopy, surface biotinylation and computational modeling, we demonstrate a novel topology for this protein. PRRT2 is a type II transmembrane protein in which only the second hydrophobic segment spans the plasma membrane, whereas the first one is associated with the internal surface of the membrane and forms a helix-loop-helix structure without crossing it. Most importantly, the large proline-rich N-terminal domain is not exposed to the extracellular space but is localized intracellularly, and only the short C terminus is extracellular (Ncyt/Cexo topology). Accordingly, we show that PRRT2 interacts with the Src homology 3 domain-bearing protein Intersectin 1, an intracellular protein involved in synaptic vesicle cycling.

            "abstract": "© 2016 by the authors.Cellulose acetate (CA) nanoparticles were combined with two antimicrobial agents, namely lemongrass (LG) essential oil and Cu-ferrite nanoparticles. The preparation method of CA nanocapsules (NCs), with the two antimicrobial agents, was based on the nanoprecipitation method using the solvent/anti-solvent technique. Several physical and chemical analyses were performed to characterize the resulting NCs and to study their formation mechanism. The size of the combined antimicrobial NCs was found to be ca. 220 nm. The presence of Cu-ferrites enhanced the attachment of LG essential oil into the CA matrix. The magnetic properties of the combined construct were weak, due to the shielding of Cu-ferrites from the polymeric matrix, making them available for drug delivery applications where spontaneous magnetization effects should be avoided. The antimicrobial properties of the NCs were significantly enhanced with respect to CA/LG only. This work opens novel routes for the development of organic/inorganic nanoparticles with exceptional antimicrobial activities.",

Specific pulse generators and miniaturized applicators are necessary to properly deliver this category of voltage signals to biological loads. In this context, we propose the design of a versatile nsPEFs applicator, developed following the guidelines typical of microwave propagating systems. The designed microchamber is suitable for in vitro exposure to undistorted pulses with duration down to 1-3 ns during single and multi cell experiments. Further features are: high efficiency (above 0.95), high cell viability by the integration of microfluidic components, real time monitoring of the biological sample and of the pulse propagation. These features can be considered as designing rules for new nanosecond and sub-nanosecond applicators, to ensure experimental repeatability and reproducibility when the impact of propagation on pulse signals is no more negligible.",

Recently, a series of computational models based on porous media theory has been proposed to predict tumor evolution and its interactions with the host tissue. In addition, a specialization of the original models, adapted for tumor spheroids, has been proposed and validated experimentally. However, due to the complexity of the modeling framework, a systematic understanding of the role of the parameters governing the equations is still lacking. In this work, we perform a parametric analysis on a set of fundamental parameters appearing in the model equations. We investigate the effects of a variation of these coefficients on the spheroid growth curves and, in particular, on the final radii reached by the cell aggregates in the growth saturation stage. Finally, we provide a discussion of the results and give a brief summary of our findings.",

Examples of popular compression formats are Google's VP9 and MPEG's MP3 for video and audio data, respectively. Recently, researchers focused on the applicability of compression techniques for haptic data too. One of these approaches, called the deadband compression approach, transmits new haptic stimuli to the receiver side only when the user is able to actually perceive the change of the stimulus with respect to the previously transmitted one. However, no deadband compression approach has been presented and evaluated for cutaneous stimuli. In this work we extend the deadband approach to cutaneous haptic data. A force-controlled cutaneous device provides the human operator with cutaneous feedback from a virtual environment. A new cutaneous stimulus is applied at the master side only if the human operator is able to sense the change with respect to the previous one. This perceptual threshold is the just notifiable difference (JND). Results show an average bit rate reduction of 61.7% with no performance degradation.",

This material presents tunable, fast biodegradation rates, but its products are less acidic than those of other biosorbable polymers like PLGA, thus presenting a better biocompatibility profile and the possibility to carry pH-sensitive payloads. A method for the production of monodisperse and spherical nanoparticles is proposed; drug delivery kinetics and blood protein adsorption were measured to evaluate the functional properties of these nanoparticles as drug carriers. The copolymer was labelled with a fluorescent dye for internalisation tests, and rhodamine B was used as a model cargo to study transport and release inside cultured cells. Biological tests demonstrated good cytocompatibility, significant cell internalisation and the possibility to vehiculate non-cell penetrating moieties into endothelial cells. Taken together, these results support the potential use of this nanoparticulate system for systemic administration of drugs.",

            "abstract": "© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016. ZnO nanomaterials are gaining lots of attention due to their biocompatible nature coupled with promising piezoelectric properties, envisioning a new generation of lead-free smart materials. Herein, an effective strategy to improve the piezoelectric behaviour of sputtered ZnO thin films is proposed by introducing a nanobranched porous thin film structure composed by a network of randomly-oriented wurtzite crystallites, rather than using compact ZnO thin films, considered in this work as a conventional reference for sputtered ZnO thin film structures. The nanobranched ZnO structure shows a hydrophilic behavior together with a piezoelectric output voltage of around 3 V. In comparison, compact ZnO thin films exhibit a maximum piezoelectric voltage generation below 0.8 V and a hydrophobic state. The more defective structure of the nanobranched ZnO thin films, with respect of the long-range ordered crystal structure of compact ZnO thin films, reduces free carrier concentration and mobility, thus limiting the screening potential and at the same time improving piezoelectric voltage generation. All the characterization results highlight the promising perspectives in using nanobranched ZnO thin films as novel piezoelectric materials for biosensing and tissue engineering applications, as well as for lead-free piezoelectric sensors and energy harvesting systems.",

A novel MATLAB/Simulink based modeling and simulation environment for the design and rapid prototyping of state-of-the-art aircraft control systems is proposed. The toolbox, named APRICOT, is able to simulate the longitudinal and laterodirectional dynamics of an aircraft separately, as well as the complete 6 degrees of freedom dynamics. All details of the dynamics can be easily customized in the toolbox, some examples are shown in the paper. Moreover, different aircraft models can be easily integrated. The main goal of APRICOT is to provide a simulation environment to test and validate different control laws with different aircraft models. Hence, the proposed toolbox has applicability both for educational purposes and control rapid prototyping. With respect to similar software packages, APRICOT is customizable in all its aspects, and has been released as open source software. An interface with Flightgear Simulator allows for online visualization of the flight. Examples of control design with simulation experiments are reported and commented.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 Wang et al. The endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycerol (2-AG), a key modulator of synaptic transmission in mammalian brain, is produced in dendritic spines and then crosses the synaptic junction to depress neurotransmitter release. Here we report that 2-AG-dependent retrograde signaling also mediates an enduring enhancement of glutamate release, as assessed with independent tests, in the lateral perforant path (LPP), one of two cortical inputs to the granule cells of the dentate gyrus. Induction of this form of long-term potentiation (LTP) involved two types of glutamate receptors, changes in postsynaptic calcium, and the postsynaptic enzyme that synthesizes 2-AG. Stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy confirmed that CB1cannabinoid receptors are localized presynaptically to LPP terminals, while the inhibition or knockout of the receptors eliminated LPP-LTP. Suppressing the enzyme that degrades 2-AG dramatically enhanced LPP potentiation, while overexpressing it produced the opposite effect. Priming with a CB1agonist markedly reduced the threshold for LTP. Latrunculin A, which prevents actin polymerization, blocked LPP-LTP when applied extracellularly but had no effect when infused postsynaptically into granule cells, indicating that critical actin remodeling resides in the presynaptic compartment. Importantly, there was no evidence for the LPP form of potentiation in the Schaffer-commissural innervation of field CA1 or in the medial perforant path. Peripheral injections of compounds that block or enhance LPP-LTP had corresponding effects on the formation of long-term memory for cues conveyed to the dentate gyrus by the LPP. Together, these results indicate that the encoding of information carried by a principal hippocampal afferent involves an unusual, regionally differentiated form of plasticity.",

We propose a very-low complexity sensor able to measure a pressure variation (up to 4 MPa) and to identify with accuracy a contact event at around 10 kPa. The overall pressure/touch sensor integrates a transducer, based on piezo capacitive material, coupled with a read-out circuit designed around a ring-oscillator. This converts the capacitance variation of the transducer into a quasi-digital signal characterized by a frequency range of 36.3-270 kHz with a very low standard deviation (2.3 kHz) and a sensitivity of 2.2 Hz/Pa. The tight integration of the electronics with the transducer results in a very compact all-in-one sensor system (overall size is 20 mm × 20 mm × 10 mm). Further, a major benefit of a low complexity design is the low power consumption, measured to be ∼370 μW. Based on a quasi-digital approach (event-driven), the system is well suited for impulse-based wireless communication.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 Elsevier B.V.The alarming energy and environmental crisis of our modern era necessitates scientists to propose alternatives to replace the scarce and harmful fossil fuels. The Sun, as a free, and abundant clean energy resource, presents a motivation for researchers to convert the sunlight to electrical power and store the H2 as an energy carrier by developing solar cells as well as water splitting devices, respectively. One of the fundamental parts of a solar energy convertor (solar cell/photoelectrochemical device), where the reduction reaction occurs, is the counter electrode (CE); the CE is commonly based on rare Pt. It is critical to substitute costly CEs with efficient, low-cost replacements, which would draw widespread attention to two-dimensional (2D) materials. Over the past few years, graphene and graphene-like materials, especially transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC), and also their hybrid systems have been suggested to be new path to electronic/optoelectronic devices for their unusual properties. The growing number of studies and research articles published on 2D counter electrodes call for a comprehensive outlook on new approaches to electrode fabrications and optimization methods, along with a clear classification of 2D material-based counter electrodes. Essentially, reviewing the most accredited papers, much light is shed on a global energy research roadmap accelerating scientists’ efforts in this area. In this review, we have focused on 2D materials used as CEs; mainly graphene sheets in pure, doped, or composite forms; as well as TMDC-based CEs. In each section, the most common syntheses and characterization approaches are reviewed as well as introducing the most efficient systems.",

In particular, we discuss two fundamentally different kinds of statistical relational models, both of which can scale to massive data sets. The first is based on latent feature models such as tensor factorization and multiway neural networks. The second is based on mining observable patterns in the graph. We also show how to combine these latent and observable models to get improved modeling power at decreased computational cost. Finally, we discuss how such statistical models of graphs can be combined with text-based information extraction methods for automatically constructing knowledge graphs from the Web.

Behavioral and neuropsychological studies suggest that real actions and pantomimed actions tap, at least in part, different neural systems. Inspired by studies showing weightattunement in real grasps, here we asked whether (and to what extent) kinematics of pantomimed reach-to-grasp movement can reveal the weight of the pretended target. To address this question, we instructed participants (n = 15) either to grasp or pretend to grasp toward two differently weighted objects, i.e., a light object and heavy object. Using linear discriminant analysis, we then proceeded to classify the weight of the target - either real or pretended - on the basis of the recorded movement patterns. Classification analysis revealed that pantomimed reach-to-grasp movements retained information about object weight, although to a lesser extent than real grasp movements. These results are discussed in relation to the mechanisms underlying the control of real and pantomimed grasping movements.",

Endocytosed SV can travel directly into the recycling pool or recycle through endosomes but little is known about the molecular actors regulating the switch between these SV recycling routes. ADP ribosylation factor 6 (Arf6) is a small GTPase known to participate in constitutive trafficking between plasma membrane and early endosomes. Here, we have morphologically and functionally investigated Arf6-silenced hippocampal synapses and found an activity dependent accumulation of synaptic endosome-like organelles and increased releasecompetent docked SVs. These features were phenocopied by pharmacological blockage of Arf6 activation. The data reveal an unexpected role for this small GTPase in reducing the size of the readily releasable pool of SVs and in channeling retrieved SVs toward direct recycling rather than endosomal sorting. We propose that Arf6 acts at the presynapse to define the fate of an endocytosed SV.",

One of them is the fact that robots are still not able to perceive some important communication cues naturally used by humans, e.g. gaze. In the recent past, eye gaze in robot perception was substituted by its proxy, head orientation. Such an approach is still adopted in many applications today. In this paper we introduce performance improvements to an eye tracking system we previously developed and use it to explore if this approximation is appropriate. More precisely, we compare the impact of the use of eye- or head-based gaze estimation in a human robot interaction experiment with the iCub robot and naïve subjects. We find that the possibility to exploit the richer information carried by eye gaze has a significant impact on the interaction. As a result, our eye tracking system allows for a more efficient human-robot collaboration than a comparable head tracking approach, according to both quantitative measures and subjective evaluation by the human participants.",

            "abstract": "© 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg (outside the USA). Rationale: The endocannabinoid system is an important modulator of brain reward signaling. Investigations have focused on cannabinoid (CB1) receptors, because dissection of specific contributions of individual endocannabinoids has been limited by the available toolset. While we recently described an important role for the endocannabinoid anandamide in the regulation of social reward, it remains to be determined whether the other major endocannabinoid, 2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycerol (2-AG), serves a similar or different function. Objectives: To study the role of 2-AG in natural reward, we used a transgenic mouse model (MGL-Tg mice) in which forebrain 2-AG levels are selectively reduced. We complemented behavioral analysis with measurements of brain 2-AG levels. Methods: We tested male MGL-Tg mice in conditioned place preference (CPP) tasks for high-fat food, social contact, and cocaine. We measured 2-AG content in the brain regions of interest by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. Results: Male MGL-Tg mice are impaired in developing CPP for high-fat food and social interaction, but do develop CPP for cocaine. Furthermore, compared to isolated mice, levels of 2-AG in socially stimulated wild-type mice are higher in the nucleus accumbens and ventral hippocampus (183 and 140 % of controls, respectively), but unchanged in the medial prefrontal cortex. Conclusions: The results suggest that reducing 2-AG-mediated endocannabinoid signaling impairs social and high-fat food reward in male mice, and that social stimulation mobilizes 2-AG in key brain regions implicated in the control of motivated behavior. The time course of this response differentiates 2-AG from anandamide, whose role in mediating social reward was previously documented.",

Explicitly, we present a simple synthetic pathway for the synthesis of copper telluride [Cu(2-x)Te] nanoparticles (NPs) stabilized by highly hydrophobic surfactants. The structural, optical and electrical properties were examined in relation to the cumulative diameter of the copper telluride NPs using various surfactants. Transmission electron micrography (TEM) suggests the increasing hydrophobic character of the surfactants is a factor for the morphological changes in the copper telluride NPs. Electrical conductivity studies of copper telluride nanoparticles were carried out at room temperature. The current-voltage (I-V) curves are linearly symmetric towards the origin inferring that the contacts are ohmic and the resistance of the samples is in the range from 1-5 Ω. UV-vis spectroscopy gave optical band gap values of 3.42 eV, 3.40 eV and 3.37 eV for the (12-2-12), (14-2-14) and (16-2-16) capped copper telluride NPs, respectively. A change in the band gap with diameter demonstrates a blue shift, which may be attributed to a quantum size effect in the NPs. Broadening of the photoluminescence (PL) peak may suggest strain amongst the nanoparticles instigated by size induced quantization effects.",

It is catalyzed by the DNA/RNA polymerase (Pol) superfamily. Here, bioinformatics analysis reveals that the incoming nucleotide substrate always forms an H-bond between its 3′-OH and β-phosphate moieties upon formation of the Michaelis complex. This previously unrecognized H-bond implies a novel self-activated mechanism (SAM), which synergistically connects the in situ nucleophile formation with subsequent nucleotide addition and, importantly, nucleic acid translocation. Thus, SAM allows an elegant and efficient closed-loop sequence of chemical and physical steps for Pol catalysis. This is markedly different from previous mechanistic hypotheses. Our proposed mechanism is corroborated via ab initio QM/MM simulations on a specific Pol, the human DNA polymerase-η, an enzyme involved in repairing damaged DNA. The structural conservation of DNA and RNA Pols supports the possible extension of SAM to Pol enzymes from the three domains of life.",

We propose a novel method that arbitrates the control between the human and the robot actors in a teachingbydemonstration setting to form synergy between the two and facilitate effective skill synthesis on the robot. We employed the human-in-the-loop teaching paradigm to teleoperate and demonstrate a complex task execution to the robot in real-time. As the human guides the robot to perform the task, the robot obtains the skill online during the demonstration. To encode the robotic skill we employed Locally Weighted Regression that fits local models to specific state region of the task based on the human demonstration. If the robot is in the state region where no local models exist, the control over the robotic mechanism is given to the human to perform the teaching. When local models are gradually obtained in that region, the control is given to the robot so that the human can examine its performance already during the demonstration stage, and take actions accordingly. This enables a co-adaptation between the agents and contributes to a faster and more efficient teaching. As a proof-of-concept, we realised the proposed robot teaching system on a haptic robot with the task of generation of a desired vertical force on a horizontal plane with unknown stiffness properties.",

Absolute analyte quantification by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is rarely pursued in metabolomics, even though this would allow researchers to compare results obtained using different techniques. Here we report on a new protocol that permits, after pH-controlled serum protein removal, the sensitive quantification (limit of detection [LOD] = 5-25 μM) of hydrophilic nutrients and metabolites in the extracellular medium of cells in cultures. The method does not require the use of databases and uses PULCON (pulse length-based concentration determination) quantitative NMR to obtain results that are significantly more accurate and reproducible than those obtained by CPMG (Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill) sequence or post-processing filtering approaches. Three practical applications of the method highlight its flexibility under different cell culture conditions. We identified and quantified (i) metabolic differences between genetically engineered human cell lines, (ii) alterations in cellular metabolism induced by differentiation of mouse myoblasts into myotubes, and (iii) metabolic changes caused by activation of neurotransmitter receptors in mouse myoblasts. Thus, the new protocol offers an easily implementable, efficient, and versatile tool for the investigation of cellular metabolism and signal transduction.",

In this paper, we show that neuronal assemblies plated on Micro Electrode Arrays present synchronized, low frequency firing patterns similar to in vivo slow wave oscillations, which are a key parameter of sleep-like state. Although neuronal cultures lack the characteristic high-frequency waves of wakefulness, it is possible to modulate their spontaneous firing pattern through the administration of specific neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine. We thus stimulated the cortical cultures with an agonist of acetylcholine receptor, Carbachol, which caused a desynchronization of the spontaneous firing of the cultures. We recorded and monitored the cultures for a period of over 31 h. We analyzed the electrophysiological signals by exploiting novel methodological approaches, taking into account the different temporal scales of the recorded signals, and considering both spikes and local field potentials. Supporting the electrophysiological analysis results, gene expressions of targeted genes showed the activation of specific markers involved in sleep-wake rhythms. Our results demonstrate that the Carbachol treatment induces desynchronization of neuronal activity, altering sleep-like properties in an in vitro model.",

Progress in the integration of nanocrystals with polymers has enabled the creation of materials for applications ranging from photovoltaics to biosensing. However, controlling the nanocrystal segregation and aggregation in the polymer phase remains a challenging task, especially because nanocrystals tend to form amorphous clusters inside the polymer matrix. Here, we present the ability of octapod-shaped particles to overcome their strong entropy-driven tendency to aggregate disorderly and form instead centipede-like linear arrays that are randomly oriented and fully embedded in polystyrene films upon controlled solvent evaporation. This behavior cannot be entirely described by short-range van der Waals interactions between the octapods in the polymer solution. An important role here is played by the increment of the viscosity of the medium during the evaporation of the solvent, which prevents disaggregation of the chains once they are formed. We show that increasing the octapod loading in the blends does not impact the length of the linear arrays beyond a critical length, while it favors instead chain demixing to form self-segregated regions of parallel interlocked chains. Our experiments evidence that softening of the polymer matrix by ex situ heating of the films induces a tail-to-tail coupling of the preformed chains and leads to the formation of longer linear structures of octapods, up to 2 μm long. The presence of 1D arrays of octapods in free-standing polystyrene films improves the creep response by a remarkable 37%, owing to an octapod pinning effect of the polymer matrix.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 Signori et al. Background: Microbial lipids can represent a valuable alternative feedstock for biodiesel production in the context of a viable bio-based economy. This production can be driven by cultivating some oleaginous microorganisms on crude-glycerol, a 10 % (w/w) by-product produced during the transesterification process from oils into biodiesel. Despite attractive, the perspective is still economically unsustainable, mainly because impurities in crude glycerol can negatively affect microbial performances. In this view, the selection of the best cell factory, together with the development of a robust and effective production process are primary requirements. Results: The present work compared crude versus pure glycerol as carbon sources for lipid production by three different oleaginous yeasts: Rhodosporidium toruloides (DSM 4444), Lipomyces starkeyi (DSM 70295) and Cryptococcus curvatus (DSM 70022). An efficient yet simple feeding strategy for avoiding the lag phase caused by growth on crude glycerol was developed, leading to high biomass and lipid production for all the tested yeasts. Flow-cytometry and fourier transform infrared (FTIR) microspectroscopy, supported by principal component analysis (PCA), were used as non-invasive and quick techniques to monitor, compare and analyze the lipid production over time. Gas chromatography (GC) analysis completed the quali-quantitative description. Under these operative conditions, the highest lipid content (up to 60.9 % wt/wt) was measured in R. toruloides, while L. starkeyi showed the fastest glycerol consumption rate (1.05 g L-1 h-1). Being productivity the most industrially relevant feature to be pursued, under the presented optimized conditions R. toruloides showed the best lipid productivity (0.13 and 0.15 g L-1 h-1 on pure and crude glycerol, respectively). Conclusions: Here we demonstrated that the development of an efficient feeding strategy is sufficient in preventing the inhibitory effect of crude glycerol, and robust enough to ensure high lipid accumulation by three different oleaginous yeasts. Single cell and in situ analyses allowed depicting and comparing the transition between growth and lipid accumulation occurring differently for the three different yeasts. These data provide novel information that can be exploited for screening the best cell factory, moving towards a sustainable microbial biodiesel production.",

We have studied the local structure of a Ba(Fe1-xCox)2As2 superconductor using temperature dependent extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) measurements. Polarized EXAFS at the Fe K-edge on an optimally doped (x = 0.06) single crystal has permitted us to determine atomic displacements across the superconducting transition temperature (Tc). The Fe-As bondlength hardly shows any change with temperature; however, the Fe-Fe sublattice reveals a sharp anomaly across Tc, indicated by a significant drop in mean square relative displacements, similar to the one known for cuprates and A15-type superconductors. We have also found a large atomic disorder around the substituted Co, revealed by polarized Co K-edge EXAFS measurements. The Co-Fe/Co bonds are more flexible than the Fe-Fe bonds with the As-height in Co-containing tetrahedra being larger than the one in FeAs4. The results suggest that the local Fe-Fe bondlength fluctuations and the atomic disorder in this sub-lattice should have some important role in the superconductivity of Ba(Fe1-xCox)2As2 pnictides.",

            "abstract": "© 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.Automatic mating of electronic connectors is an indispensable process for a wiring harness assembly system on assembly line of electrical elements. It is therefore key technology to develop error recovery method when the connector mating process is jammed. This paper presents four search strategies for electronic connectors mating with initial uncertain position error. For each method, we study the relationship between the force sensor signal and relative position within connector pair. We also study the search space requirements for each method since there is not always enough room existed for connector searching. Performance of each method is finally studied by both theoretical and experimental analysis. The experiment results show that the proposed strategies can diagnose the position errors occurring in the assembly process correctly, and realize error recovery effectively.",

Thiol-polyethylene glycol adsorption and avidin/biotin binding kinetics were monitored by exploiting the high sensitivity of grating-coupling SPR under azimuthal control. A time saturation binding kinetics reduction of 82% and 24% for polyethylene and avidin adsorption was obtained, respectively, due to the fluid mixing enhancement by means of the SAW-generated chaotic advection. These results represent the first implementation of a nanostructured SAW-SPR microfluidic biochip capable of significantly improving the molecule binding kinetics on a single, portable device.

Most biological N2 fixation occurs in root nodules of plants that respond to bacterial infection by establishing symbiosis with selected prokaryotes. The plants provide energy metabolites and a microoxic environment to the bacterial symbionts to facilitate their capacity of N2 fixation. Despite enormous advances in the molecular genetics of this symbiosis between plants and nodulating bacteria, we still do not understand fundamental aspects which determine the efficiency of N2 fixation in the nodules, and therefore the capacity to biologically enrich agricultural soils. Here we provide an overview of the central features of the energy metabolism that sustains N2 fixation, with emphasis on the bacterial respiratory chain supplying the electrons and ATP required for the nitrogenase reaction. We discuss common trends and specific variations in the integrated process of respiratory electron transport and N2 fixation. Among such variations we introduce green complex I, an ancient version of NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase that is present in several Rhizobiaceae and may facilitate N2 fixation.",

The concept of synergy has been proposed to indicate functional modules that may simplify the control of hand postures by simultaneously recruiting sets of muscles and joints. However, whether and to what extent synergic hand postures are encoded as such at a cortical level remains unknown. Here, we combined kinematic, electromyography, and brain activity measures obtained by functional magnetic resonance imaging while subjects performed a variety of movements towards virtual objects. Hand postural information, encoded through kinematic synergies, were represented in cortical areas devoted to hand motor control and successfully discriminated individual grasping movements, significantly outperforming alternative somatotopic or muscle-based models. Importantly, hand postural synergies were predicted by neural activation patterns within primary motor cortex. These findings support a novel cortical organization for hand movement control and open potential applications for brain-computer interfaces and neuroprostheses.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland. Achieving accurate and reliable kinematic hand pose reconstructions represents a challenging task. The main reason for this is the complexity of hand biomechanics, where several degrees of freedom are distributed along a continuous deformable structure. Wearable sensing can represent a viable solution to tackle this issue, since it enables a more natural kinematic monitoring. However, the intrinsic accuracy (as well as the number of sensing elements) of wearable hand pose reconstruction (HPR) systems can be severely limited by ergonomics and cost considerations. In this paper, we combined the theoretical foundations of the optimal design of HPR devices based on hand synergy information, i.e., the inter-joint covariation patterns, with textile goniometers based on knitted piezoresistive fabrics (KPF) technology, to develop, for the first time, an optimally-designed under-sensed glove for measuring hand kinematics. We used only five sensors optimally placed on the hand and completed hand pose reconstruction (described according to a kinematic model with 19 degrees of freedom) leveraging upon synergistic information. The reconstructions we obtained from five different subjects were used to implement an unsupervised method for the recognition of eight functional grasps, showing a high degree of accuracy and robustness.",

The conformal P3HT coating on the nanocomposite surface does not alter or reduce superhydrophicity while maintaining its reversible enhanced thermochromism. The polymeric matrix of the superhydrophobic surface is comprised of a blend of poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) copolymer and an acrylic adhesive. Based on detailed X-ray diffraction measurements, this long-lasting, repeatable and hysteresis-free thermochromic effect is attributed to the enhancement of the Bragg peak associated with the d-spacing of interchain directional packing (100) which remains unaltered during several heating-cooling cycles. We propose that the superhydrophobic surface confines π-π interchain stacking in P3HT with uniform d-spacing into its nanostructured texture resulting in better packing and reduction in face-on orientation. The rapid response of the system to sudden temperature changes is also demonstrated by water droplet impact and bounce back on heated surfaces. This effect can be exploited for embedded thin film temperature sensors for metal coatings.",

Here, for epitaxial graphene grown on SiC, we determine the effect of charge transfer from the SiC substrate on the local density of states (LDOS) of trilayer graphene using scaning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy and angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). Different spectra are observed and are attributed to the existence of two stable polytypes of trilayer: Bernal (ABA) and rhomboedreal (ABC) staking. Their electronic properties strongly depend on the charge transfer from the substrate. We show that the LDOS of ABC stacking shows an additional peak located above the Dirac point in comparison with the LDOS of ABA stacking. The observed LDOS features, reflecting the underlying symmetry of the two polytypes, were reproduced by explicit calculations within density functional theory (DFT) including the charge transfer from the substrate. These findings demonstrate the pronounced effect of stacking order and charge transfer on the electronic structure of trilayer or few layer graphene. Our approach represents a significant step toward understand the electronic properties of graphene layer under electrical field.",

At each catalytic step, the acyl intermediates are transiently delivered from ACP to the active site of the enzymatic counterparts and, at the same time, are protected from the solvent to prevent nonselective reactivity. Yet, the molecular determinants of such a universal transition - termed chain flipping - remain poorly understood. Here we capture the atomic-level details of the chain-flipping mechanism by using metadynamics simulations. We observe the fatty-acid chain gliding through the protein-protein interface with barely 30% of its surface exposed to water molecules. The small ACP's helix III acts as gatekeeper of the process, and we find its conformational plasticity critical for a successful substrate transfer. The results are in agreement with a wide range of experimental observations and provide unprecedented insight on the molecular determinants and driving forces of the chain-flipping process.",

Uniform graphene layers on 4 silicon wafers were deposited by chemical vapor deposition using the CMOS compatible Mo catalyst. Removal of the Mo layer after graphene deposition results in a transfer-free and controlled placement of the graphene on the underlying SiO2. Moreover, pre-patterning the Mo layer allows customizable graphene geometries to be directly obtained, something that has never been achieved before. This process is extremely suitable for the large-scale fabrication of MEMS/NEMS sensors, especially those benefitting from specific properties of graphene, such as gas sensing.",

In the frontal eye field (FEF), a key area enabling top-down attention, attention induced firing rate changes are profound, but its effect on different cell types is unknown. Moreover, FEF is the only cortical area investigated in which attention does not affect rate variability, as assessed by the Fano factor, suggesting that task engagement affects cortical state nonuniformly. Weshow that putative interneurons in FEF of Macaca mulatta show stronger attentional rate modulation than putative pyramidal cells. Partitioning rate variability reveals that both cell types reduce rate variability with attention, but more strongly so in narrow-spiking cells. The effects are captured by a model in which attention stabilizes neuronal excitability, thereby reducing the expansive nonlinearity that links firing rate and variance. These results show that the effect of attention on different cell classes and different coding properties are consistent across the cortical hierarchy, acting through increased and stabilized neuronal excitability.",

Gold-copper nanoparticles (Au1-xCux NPs) have been reported as a versatile system to study various aspects related to the colloidal synthesis of bimetallic nanoparticles. In this work, Au1-xCux NPs are synthesized via a one pot approach using equimolar amounts of Au and Cu. Different compositions are obtained by changing the reaction temperature. By taking aliquots at crucial stages of the synthesis and combining several techniques, such as elemental analysis, X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, it was possible to shed light on the synthesis mechanism: The formation of Au NPs occurs at low temperature, then the higher the synthesis temperature the higher the Cu content in the NPs. In parallel to the Au NPs formation, results of energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analyses carried out in scanning transmission electron microscopy mode suggest the formation of a Cu-rich phase at the early stages of the synthesis. Such a phase, not detectable by X-ray diffraction, acts as a reservoir of Cu species that are slowly released to form the Au1-xCux alloy NPs through a digestive ripening-like process. The reaction temperature and annealing time affect the final Au: Cu ratio but had no significant effect on the final size of the particles, which for all compositions is approximately 14 nm.",

To tackle this issue, audio sensory devices have been incorporated, both alone or in combination with video, giving birth in the past decade, to a considerable amount of research. In this article, audio-based automated surveillance methods are organized into a comprehensive survey: A general taxonomy, inspired by the more widespread video surveillance field, is proposed to systematically describe the methods covering background subtraction, event classification, object tracking, and situation analysis. For each of these tasks, all the significant works are reviewed, detailing their pros and cons and the context for which they have been proposed. Moreover, a specific section is devoted to audio features, discussing their expressiveness and their employment in the above-described tasks. Differing from other surveys on audio processing and analysis, the present one is specifically targeted to automated surveillance, highlighting the target applications of each described method and providing the reader with a systematic and schematic view useful for retrieving the most suited algorithms for each specific requirement.",

Many works suggest that blind adults show similar or even enhanced performance for localization of auditory cues compared to sighted adults (Collignon, Voss, Lassonde, &amp; Lepore, 2009). To date, the investigation of auditory spatial localization in children with visual impairments has provided contrasting results. Here we report, for the first time, that contrary to visually impaired adults, children with low vision or total blindness show a significant impairment in the localization of static sounds. These results suggest that simple auditory spatial tasks are compromised in children, and that this capacity recovers over time.",

Our formulation encompasses both Vector-valued Manifold Regularization and Co-regularized Multi-view Learning, providing in particular a unifying framework linking these two important learning approaches. In the case of the least square loss function, we provide a closed form solution, which is obtained by solving a system of linear equations. In the case of Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification, our formulation generalizes in particular both the binary Laplacian SVM to the multi-class, multi-view settings and the multi-class Simplex Cone SVM to the semi-supervised, multi-view settings. The solution is obtained by solving a single quadratic optimization problem, as in standard SVM, via the Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO) approach.

The aim of this work is to provide to the clinician a unique larynx panorama, obtained through an automatic frame selection strategy to discard non-informative frames. Anisotropic diffusion filtering was exploited to lower the noise level while encouraging the selection of meaningful image features, and a feature-based stitching approach was carried out to generate the panorama. The frame selection strategy, tested on on six pathological NB endoscopic videos, was compared with standard strategies, as uniform and random sampling, showing higher performance of the subsequent stitching procedure, both visually, in terms of vascular structure preservation, and numerically, through a blur estimation metric.",

Stopping the needle before the first vein wall or going completely through the vein are the common causes of failure, and can potentially cause severe damage to the soft tissue. In this study we propose a new robotic system to improve the venipuncture procedure. The system is based on a high resolution motion stage and a new detection system able to measure the electrical impedance of tissue around the IV needle tip. This detection system allows the discrimination of the different tissue types accessed during the insertion process, and a fast and robust detection of vein entry by detecting blood. This paper presents the design and development of this new robot-Assisted venipuncture system. Experiments in realistic phantoms were designed and undertaken for the system's evaluation, which also demonstrated the effective performance of the proposed venipuncture detection system.",

            "abstract": "© 2015 IEEE. Manual material handling is one of the most frequent operations in industrial manufacturing processes. To avoid undesirable spinal loads, workers are often required to use external aid devices. This paper presents the analysis and design concept of a wearable assistive device for reducing the spinal loads during lifting tasks. A simplified model is used to compare the effects of two possible configurations for the device: the application of a force (a) parallel and (b) perpendicular to the spine. The model suggests that the perpendicular configuration (b) is preferable to (a). A subsequent numerical analysis suggests that the assistive device reduces substantially the spinal compression. This paper also discusses the design of a hardware prototype, that allows the operator to move mostly unhindered while performing lifting tasks. In particular the leg and torso movements on the sagittal plane are covered by the 90% and 60% respectively, while the movements on the frontal plane are fully covered.",

Thus, it is not surprising that much effort has been devoted to designing haptic systems able to suitably reproduce this information. At the same time, wearability has gained an increasing importance as a novel paradigm to enable a more effective and naturalistic human robot interaction. Capitalizing upon our previous works on grounded softness devices, in this paper we present the Wearable Fabric Yielding Display (W-FYD), a fabric-based tactile display for multi-cue delivery that can be worn by user's finger. W-FYD enables to implement both passive and active tactile exploration. Different levels of stiffness can be reproduced by modulating the stretching state of a fabric through two DC motors. An additional vertical degree of freedom is implemented through a lifting mechanism, which enables to convey softness stimuli to the user's finger pad. Furthermore, a sliding effect on the finger can be also induced. Experiments with humans show the effectiveness of W-FYD for haptic multi-cue delivery.",

Which technique should be preferred or whether they are equivalent with respect to bacterial adhesion is unclear. Purpose: The purpose of this in vitro study was to determine the affinity of bacterial biofilm to dental restorative composite resins placed directly and indirectly. Material and methods: Five direct composite resins for restorations (Venus Diamond, Adonis, Optifil, Enamel Plus HRi, Clearfil Majesty Esthetic) and 3 indirect composite resins (Gradia, Estenia, Signum) were selected. The materials were incubated in unstimulated whole saliva for 1 day. The biofilms grown were collected and their bacterial cells counted. In parallel, the composite resin surface morphology was analyzed with atomic force microscopy. Both bacterial cell count and surface topography parameters were subjected to statistical analysis (α=.05). Results: Indirect composite resins showed significantly lower levels than direct composite resins for bacterial cell adhesion, (P&lt;.001). No significant differences were observed within the direct composite resins (P≥.05). However, within the indirect composite resins a significantly lower level was found for Gradia than Estenia or Signum (P&lt;.01). A partial correlation was observed between composite resin roughness and bacterial adhesion when the second and particularly the third-order statistical moments of the composite resin height distributions were considered. Conclusions: Indirect dental restorative composite resins were found to be less prone to biofilm adhesion than direct composite resins. A correlation of bacterial adhesion to surface morphology exists that is described by kurtosis; thus, advanced data analysis is required to discover possible insights into the biologic effects of morphology.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 IEEE.The work presented herein, attempts to address the problem of designing stepping recovery controllers for compliantly actuated humanoid robots. Based on the decomposition of the stepping procedure into three distinct phases, which are characterized by unique combinations of configurations and impedance levels, the contrivance of a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) optimization process allows for the production of a corresponding number of controllers. The penalties associated with the proposed cost functions, which account for compliant dynamics and balance-related parameters alike, are selected in a systematic manner that facilitates the generation of the appropriate impedance levels required for each particular phase of the stepping motion. Subsequently, the superimposition of gravity compensation control, onto the original LQR controllers, renders them nonlinear and theoretically capable of tracking referential stepping trajectories. The associated referential motor positions are then generated by exploiting a formula relating the Centre of-Pressure (CoP) to the compliant ankle dynamics, thereby satisfying the balancing constraints whilst also accounting for the system's inherent under-actuation. Thus, the technique's novelty stems from its explicit consideration of flexible joint dynamics and deflection torques, for the design of the desired impedance levels and joint stepping trajectories. The Series Elastic Actuator (SEA) powered COmpliant huMANoid (COMAN), has served as an avatar of the stepping recovery methodology that is expounded in the paper.",

Using these methods allow to exploit the full capabilities of the entire body of redundant, floating-base robots in compliant multi-contact interaction with the environment, to execute any single task and simultaneous multiple tasks. This paper presents an attractor-based whole-body motion control (WBMC) system, developed for torque-control of floating-base robots. The attractors are defined as atomic control modules that work in parallel to, and independently from the other attractors, generating joint torques that aim to modify the state of the robot so that the error in a target condition is minimized. Balance of the robot is guaranteed by the simultaneous activation of an attractor to the minimum effort configuration, and of an attractor to a zero joint momentum. A novel formulation of the minimum effort is proposed based on the assumption that whenever the gravitational stiffness is maximized, the effort is consequently minimized. The effectiveness of the WBMC was experimentally demonstrated with the COMAN humanoid robot in a physical simulation, in scenarios where multiple conflicting tasks had to be accomplished simultaneously.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 the authors. Schizophrenia is a chronic, disabling neuropsychiatric disorder with complex genetic origins. The development of strategies for genome manipulation in rodents provides a platform for understanding the pathogenic role of genes and for testing novel therapeutic agents. Neuregulin 1 (NRG1), a critical developmental neurotrophin, is associated with schizophrenia. The NRG1 gene undergoes extensive alternative splicing and, to date, little is known about the neurobiology of a novel NRG1 isoform, NRG1-IV, which is increased in the brains of individuals with schizophrenia and associated with genetic risk variation. Here, we developed a transgenic mouse model (NRG1-IV/NSE-tTA) in which human NRG1-IV is selectively overexpressed in a neuronal specific manner. Using a combination of molecular, biochemical, electrophysiological, and behavioral analyses, we demonstrate that NRG1-IV/NSE-tTA mice exhibit abnormal behaviors relevant to schizophrenia, including impaired sensorimotor gating, discrimination memory, and social behaviors. These neurobehavioral phenotypes are accompanied by increases in cortical expression of the NRG1 receptor, ErbB4 and the downstream signaling target, PIK3-p110δ, along with disrupted dendritic development, synaptic pathology, and altered prefrontal cortical excitatory–inhibitory balance. Pharmacological inhibition of p110δ reversed sensorimotor gating and cognitive deficits. These data demonstrate a novel role for NRG1-IV in learning, memory, and neural circuit formation and a potential neurobiological mechanism for schizophrenia risk; show that deficits are pharmacologically reversible in adulthood; and further highlight p110δ as a target for antipsychotic drug development.",

A comparison with errors obtained on energetic databases (including thermochemistry, reaction barriers, and interaction energies) indicate that most of the functionals have a coherent behavior, showing low (or high) deviations on both energy and structure data sets.

Despite the recent introduction of heavily-doped semiconductors for mid-infrared plasmonics, it still remains an open point whether such materials can compete with noble metals. We employ a whole set of figures of merit to thoroughly assess the use of heavily-doped Ge on Si as a mid-infrared plasmonic material and benchmark it against standard noble metals such as Au. In doing this, we design and model high-performance, CMOS compatible mid-infrared plasmonic sensors based on experimental material data reaching plasma frequencies up to about 1950 cm-1. We demonstrate that plasmonic Ge sensors can provide signal enhancements for vibrational spectroscopy above 3 orders of magnitude, thus representing a viable alternative to noble metals.",

            "abstract": "During speech listening motor regions are somatotopically activated, resembling the activity that subtends actual speech production, suggesting that motor commands can be retrieved from sensory inputs. Crucially, the efficient motor control of the articulators relies on the accurate anticipation of the somatosensory reafference. Nevertheless, evidence about somatosensory activities elicited by auditory speech processing is sparse. The present work looked for specific interactions between auditory speech presentation and somatosensory cortical information processing. We used an auditory speech identification task with sounds having different place of articulation (bilabials and dentals). We tested whether coupling the auditory task with a peripheral electrical stimulation of the lips would affect the pattern of sensorimotor electroencephalographic rhythms. Peripheral electrical stimulation elicits a series of spectral perturbations of which the beta rebound reflects the return-to-baseline stage of somatosensory processing. We show a left-lateralized and selective reduction in the beta rebound following lip somatosensory stimulation when listening to speech sounds produced with the lips (i.e. bilabials). Thus, the somatosensory processing could not return to baseline due to the recruitment of the same neural resources by speech stimuli. Our results are a clear demonstration that heard speech sounds are somatotopically mapped onto somatosensory cortices, according to place of articulation.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 American Chemical Society. The membrane-associated enzyme NAPE-PLD (N-acyl phosphatidylethanolamine specific-phospholipase D) generates the endogenous cannabinoid arachidonylethanolamide and other lipid signaling amides, including oleoylethanolamide and palmitoylethanolamide. These bioactive molecules play important roles in several physiological pathways including stress and pain response, appetite, and lifespan. Recently, we reported the crystal structure of human NAPE-PLD and discovered specific binding sites for the bile acid deoxycholic acid. In this study, we demonstrate that in the presence of this secondary bile acid, the stiffness of the protein measured by elastic neutron scattering increases, and NAPE-PLD is ∼7 times faster to catalyze the hydrolysis of the more unsaturated substrate N-arachidonyl-phosphatidylethanolamine, compared with N-palmitoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine. Chenodeoxycholic acid and glyco- or tauro-dihydroxy conjugates can also bind to NAPE-PLD and drive its activation. The only natural monohydroxy bile acid, lithocholic acid, shows an affinity of ∼20 μM and acts instead as a reversible inhibitor (IC50 ≈ 68 μM). Overall, these findings provide important insights into the allosteric regulation of the enzyme mediated by bile acid cofactors and reveal that NAPE-PLD responds primarily to the number and position of their hydroxyl groups.",

A solvent exchange process is exploited to first remove the N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone used for the exfoliation of graphite and then to re-disperse the exfoliated single-(SLG) and few-layer (FLG) graphene flakes, at a high concentration (∼5 g L-1), in an environmentally friendly solvent, i.e., ethanol. Anodes are realized by drop-casting the SLG- and FLG-based ink in ethanol under ambient conditions on a Cu foil without any binder or conductive agents, typically used for the fabrication of conventional LIBs. We tested our SLG- and FLG-based anodes in a half-cell configuration, achieving a reversible specific capacity of ∼500 mA h g-1 after 100 cycles at a current density of 0.1 A g-1, with coulombic efficiency &gt;99.5%. We also tested the SLG- and FLG-based anode in a full-cell configuration, exploiting commercial LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 as a cathode. The battery operates around 4.7 V with a flat-plateau voltage profile and a reversible specific capacity of ∼100 mA h g-1. The proposed electrode fabrication process is fast, low cost and industrially scalable opening the way to the optimization of energy and power densities, lifetime and safety of LIBs, while minimizing their cost and environmental impact.",

Background: The design of an appropriate microenvironment for stem cell differentiation constitutes a multitask mission and a critical step toward the clinical application of tissue substitutes. With the aim of producing a bioactive material for orthopedic applications, a transforming growth factor-β (TGF- β1)/hydroxyapatite (HA) association within an alginate-based scaffold was investigated. The bioactive scaffold was carefully designed to offer specific biochemical cues for an efficient and selective cell differentiation toward the bony and chondral lineages. Methods: Highly porous alginate scaffolds were fabricated from a mixture of calcium cross-linked alginates by means of a freeze-drying technique. In the chondral layer, the TGF in citric acid was mixed with an alginate/alginate-sulfate solution. In the bony layer, HA granules were added as bioactive signal, to offer an osteoinductive surface to the cells. Optical and scanning electron microscopy analyses were performed to assess the macromicro architecture of the biphasic scaffold. Different mechanical tests were conducted to evaluate the elastic modulus of the grafts. For the biological validation of the developed prototype, mesenchymal stem cells were loaded onto the samples; cellular adhesion, proliferation and in vivo biocompatibility were evaluated. Results and conclusions: The results successfully demonstrated the efficacy of the designed osteochondral graft, which combined interesting functional properties and biomechanical performances, thus becoming a promising candidate for osteochondral tissue-engineering applications.",

In this study, the possible biological impact of f-CNOs on zebrafish during development is investigated, evaluating different toxicity end-points such as the survival rate, hatching rate, and heart beat rate. Furthermore, a bio-distribution study of boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) functionalized CNOs in zebrafish larvae is performed by utilizing inverted selective plane illumination microscopy (iSPIM), due to its intrinsic capability of allowing for fast 3D imaging.

            "abstract": "© 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd. Good water barrier properties and biocompatibility of long-chain biopolyesters like cutin and suberin have inspired the design of synthetic mimetic materials. Most of these biopolymers are made from esterified mid-chain functionalized ω-long chain hydroxyacids. Aleuritic (9,10,16-trihydroxypalmitic) acid is such a polyhydroxylated fatty acid and is also the major constituent of natural lac resin, a relatively abundant and renewable resource. Insoluble and thermostable films have been prepared from aleuritic acid by melt-condensation polymerization in air without catalysts, an easy and attractive procedure for large scale production. Intended to be used as a protective coating, the barrier's performance is expected to be conditioned by physical and chemical modifications induced by oxygen on the air-exposed side. Hence, the chemical composition, texture, mechanical behavior, hydrophobicity, chemical resistance and biodegradation of the film surface have been studied by attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), atomic force microscopy (AFM), nanoindentation and water contact angle (WCA). It has been demonstrated that the occurrence of side oxidation reactions conditions the surface physical and chemical properties of these polyhydroxyester films. Additionally, the addition of palmitic acid to reduce the presence of hydrophilic free hydroxyl groups was found to have a strong influence on these parameters.",

            "abstract": "The onset of Alzheimer disease (AD) is influenced by several risk factors comprising diabetes. Within this context, antidiabetic drugs, including metformin, are investigated for their effect on AD. We report that in the C57B6/J mice, metformin is delivered to the brain where activates AMP-activated kinase (AMPK), its molecular target. This drug affects the levels of β- secretase (BACE1) and β-amyloid precursor protein (APP), promoting processing and aggregation of β-amyloid (Aβ), mainly in the cortex region. Moreover, metformin induces mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death by affecting the level and conformation of Translocase of the Outer Membrane 40 (TOM40), voltage-dependent anion-selective channels 1 (VDAC1) and hexokinase I (HKI), proteins involved in mitochondrial transport of molecules, including Aβ. By using biophysical techniques we found that metformin is able to directly interact with Aβ influencing its aggregation kinetics and features. These findings indicate that metformin induces different adverse effects, leading to an overall increase of the risk of AD onset.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 IEEE.Detecting human activity in the scene is a fundamental skill for robotics. Most current methods of human detection from video analysis rely on appearance or shape features, thus exhibiting severe limitations as clutter or scene complexity grow, for instance when humans are using tools. We propose a way to overcome these limitations by exploiting a motionbased human detection system relying on the regularities of human kinematics. Our method, which is implemented as an open-source software module and integrated in the humanoid robot iCub software framework, extracts relevant features of biological motion in a computationally efficient way and feeds them to the attentional system of the robot. As a result the robot can rapidly direct its attention toward the human agents in the scene, even when they are hidden or partially covered by the tools they are using. The paper describes in detail the software framework supporting the autonomous learning of a discrimination policy between biological and non-biological motion observed in a scene. Then, it provides a quantitative validation of the classification performances on a batch dataset acquired by the iCub cameras and in a scenario where both training and classification are performed online. Last, it presents experiments on the integration of the module with the iCub attention system, demonstrating the ability of the robot to selectively and rapidly redeploy its fixation point on the human activity in the scene. The experimental results show that the proposed system can reliably enable the robot to focus its attention on human activity, a fundamental first step to allow for a deeper understanding of the observed action and a careful planning of an interaction strategy with a human partner.",

Unfortunately, current methods to measure biomechanical properties are invasive and mostly limited to the surface of a cell. As a result, the mechanical behaviour of subcellular structures and organelles remains poorly characterised. Here, we show three-dimensional biomechanical images of single cells obtained with non-invasive, non-destructive Brillouin microscopy with an unprecedented spatial resolution. Our results quantify the longitudinal elastic modulus of subcellular structures. In particular, we found the nucleoli to be stiffer than both the nuclear envelope (p &lt; 0.0001) and the surrounding cytoplasm (p &lt; 0.0001). Moreover, we demonstrate the mechanical response of cells to Latrunculin-A, a drug that reduces cell stiffness by preventing cytoskeletal assembly. Our technique can therefore generate valuable insights into cellular biomechanics and its role in pathophysiology.",

KGaA, Weinheim Observation of the natural world can provide invaluable information on the mechanisms that semi-aquatic living organisms or bacteria use for their self-propulsion. Microvelia, for example, uses wax excreted from its legs to move on water in order to escape from predators or reach the bank of the river. Mimicking such mechanism, few self-propelled materials on water, as camphor, have been previously developed, but weak points like slow locomotion, short movement duration, or shape restrictions still need to be improved. This study presents a totally green self-assembled porous system, formed by the combination of a natural polymer with an essential oil that spontaneously moves on water for hours upon expulsion of the oil, with high velocities reaching 15 cm s−1. The structural characteristics of the natural polymeric composite are carefully analyzed and associated to its spontaneous movement. Surface tension experiments are also presented that connect the essential oil release with the locomotion of the porous composite films. This research work opens novel routes toward bioinspired natural materials that can be used for mimicking and studying the motion of bioorganisms and microorganisms, and for applications such as energy harvesting, aquatic pollution monitoring, drug delivery, to name few.",

In this study, the design and fabrication of porous scaffolds, made of blends of polylactic-co-caprolactone (PLC) and polylactic acid (PLA) polymers, for tissue engineering applications is reported. The scaffolds are prepared by means of a bio-safe thermally induced phase separation (TIPS) approach with or without the addition of NaCl particles used as particulate porogen. The scaffolds are characterized to assess their crystalline structure, morphology and mechanical properties, and the texture of the pores and the pore size distribution. Moreover, in vitro human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) culture tests have been carried out to demonstrate the biocompatibility of the scaffolds. The results of this study demonstrate that all of the scaffold materials processed by means of TIPS process are semi-crystalline. Furthermore, the blend composition affected polymer crystallization and, in turn, the nano and macro-structural properties of the scaffolds. Indeed, neat PLC and neat PLA crystallize into globular and randomly arranged sub micro-size scale fibrous conformations, respectively. Concomitantly, the addition of NaCl particles during the fabrication route allows for the creation of an interconnected network of large pores inside the primary structure while resulted in a significant decrease of scaffolds mechanical response. Finally, the results of cell culture tests demonstrate that both the micro and macro-structure of the scaffold affect the in vitro hMSCs adhesion and proliferation.",

Layer-by-layer of polyelectrolytes has emerged as one of the easiest and most controlled techniques to deposit ultrathin polymer layers mainly driven by electrostatic interactions. However, this kind of interaction results to be weak and easily breakable in physiological environment. Here we report on the preparation of nanocapsules completely made of natural biomaterials: a lipophilic core (soybean oil and egg lecithin as surfactant) as nanometric template and a polysaccharide-based multilayer shell (glycol chitosan and heparin) covalently cross-linked. We first modified glycol chitosan with a thiol moiety and heparin with an alkene moiety, respectively, and then we built a polymer multilayer film with a covalent cross-linkage among layers, exploiting the light initiated thiol-ene reaction, known as click chemistry. We showed the possibility to perform the covalent cross-linkage without any photoinitiator or metal catalyst, thus avoiding cytotoxic effects and further purification steps. The so realized nanocapsules resulted to be stable and completely biocompatible and, therefore, of interest for the biotechnology fields, mainly for drug delivery.",

The biological environment – more or less hurriedly – interacts with nanoparticles, reshapes their structure and changes their properties; thus modifies particles distribution, biotransformations and potential toxicity. As the understanding of nanoparticles processing, persistence, degradation and recycling will help predicting potential exposure risks, it is necessary to associate the concept of nanoparticles lifecycle to biological effects and employ (specific) methodologies to detect, quantify and follow the bioprocessing of nanoparticles in vivo over time, from the whole body level to the nanoscopic scale. Besides the composition, nanoparticles persistence/degradability is governed by their architecture and the nature/quality of the surface coating; therefore strategies can be adopted to control the long-term fate of nanoparticles in the organism.

However, the intrinsic instability of BP caused by moisture or oxygen reaction in ambient atmosphere has overshadowed its practical applications. Here, we present a liquid phase exfoliation-based approach for the production of few-layer BP (FL-BP) and the subsequent mixing with polycarbonate (PC) for the fabrication of a composite, which significantly reduces BP degradation by PC passivation. Experimentally, the functionalized PC few-layer BP (PC/FL-BP) composite shows environmental stability if compared with mechanically exfoliated BP flakes. We then use the PC/FL-BP composite as saturable absorber to study the nonlinear absorption property in a fibre laser at the 1.55 μm telecommunication wavelength. A Q-switched laser with pulse energy up to 25.2 nJ and pulse duration down to 1.65 μs is obtained at a low pump power of 71.7 mW. Our results can boost further research and scalable photonic applications, where environmentally stable few-layer BP based devices are needed.",

Rationale and Objectives: To characterize the lipidic profile of bone marrow in the calcaneus and femoral neck of healthy, osteopenic, and osteoporotic women, by using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) at 3T. The final goal was to identify specific metabolites with the potential ability to discriminate between healthy, osteopenic, and osteoporotic subjects. Materials and Methods: Sixty-two and thirty three postmenopausal women recruited to investigate calcaneus and femoral neck, respectively, underwent a bone mineral density (BMD) measurement to be classified as healthy subjects (n = 22), osteopenic (n = 45), or osteoporotic (n = 28) patients.MRS spectra were used to quantify and compare bone marrow fat resonances between the three BMD groups. Between-group differences were tested using a Welch analysis of variance. Multiple comparisons were made with the Games-Howell correction. Relationships between pairs of variables were assessed with linear correlation analysis. Reproducibility analysis was performed for all the lipid resonances in both sites. Results: The reproducibility was satisfactory. In femoral neck, methylene (L13), glycerol (L41, L43), and total lipid resonances were significantly lower in healthy as compared to osteoporotic subjects. On the other hand, in calcaneus, L13/glycerol significantly discriminated between osteopenic and osteoporotic subjects whereas L13/(unsaturated lipid) discriminated between healthy and osteopenic group. However, the reproducibility of both unsaturated lipid and glycerol resonances were less optimal. Conclusions: MRS of bone marrow lipid profiles from peripheral skeletal sites may be a promising tool for screening of large population to identify individuals with or at risk for developing osteoporosis. Moreover, it provides information about the metabolic changes occurring in bone marrow with the development of osteoporosis, which are skeletal site dependent.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 Amoah et al.Background: The World Health Organization has recommended at least four antenatal care (ANC) visits and skilled attendants at birth. Most pregnant women in rural communities in low-income countries do not achieve the minimum recommended visits and deliver without skilled attendants. With the aim of increasing number of ANC visits, reducing home deliveries, and supplementing care given by ANC clinics, a proposed system based on low-cost mobile phones and portable ultrasound scan machines was piloted. Methods: A sample of 323 pregnant women from four rural communities in the Central Region of Ghana were followed within a 11-month project. In each community, at least one health worker was trained and equipped with a mobile phone to promote ANC and hospital deliveries in her own community. If women cannot attend ANC, technicians acquired scans by using portable ultrasound machines in her community directly and sent them almost in real time to be analyzed by a gynecologist in an urban hospital. A preliminary survey to assess ANC status preceding the pilot study was conducted. During this, one hundred women who had had pregnancies within five years prior to the study were interviewed. Results: The preliminary survey showed that women who attended ANC were less likely to have a miscarriage and more likely to have delivery at hospital or clinic than those who did not, and women who attained at least four ANC visits were less likely to practice self-medication. Among the women involved in the project, 40 gave birth during the period of observation. The proposed prenatal care approach showed that 62.5 % of pregnant women who gave birth during the observation period included in the project (n=40) had their labor attended in clinics or hospitals as against 37.5 % among the cases reported in the pre-survey. One case of ectopic and two cases of breech pregnancies were detected during the pilot through the proposed approach, and appropriate medical interventions were sought. Conclusion: Our results show that the proposed prenatal care approach can make quality ANC accessible in rural communities where pregnant women have not been able to access proper ANC.",

Nevertheless, the key issue hindering PSCs full exploitation relies on their stability. Among the strategies devised to overcome this problem, the use of carbon nanostructures (CNSs) as hole transporting materials (HTMs) has given impressive results in terms of solar cells stability to moisture, air oxygen, and heat. Here, the use of a HTM based on a poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) matrix doped with organic functionalized single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and reduced graphene oxide in PSCs is proposed to achieve higher power conversion efficiencies (η = 11% and 7.3%, respectively) and prolonged shelf-life stabilities (480 h) in comparison with a benchmark PSC fabricated with a bare P3HT HTM (η = 4.3% at 480 h). Further endurance test, i.e., up to 3240 h, has shown the failure of all the PSCs based on undoped P3HT, while, on the contrary, a η of ≈8.7% is still detected from devices containing 2 wt% SWCNT-doped P3HT as HTM. The increase in photovoltaic performances and stabilities of the P3HT-CNS-based solar cell, with respect to the standard P3HT-based one, is attributed to the improved interfacial contacts between the doped HTM and the adjacent layers.",

This paper proves the uncertainty bound for the multiple Gaussian functions, termed multiple Gaussians Uncertainty (MGU), which significantly generalizes the uncertainty principle for the single Gaussian function. First, as a theoretical contribution, we prove that the momentum (velocity) and position for the sum of multiple Gaussians wave function are theoretically bounded. Second, as for a practical application, we show that the bound can be well exploited for object tracking to detect anomalies of local movement in an online learning framework. By integrating MGU with a given object tracker, we demonstrate that uncertainty principle can provide remarkable robustness in tracking. Extensive experiments are done to show that the proposed MGU can significantly help base trackers overcome the object drifting and reach state-of-the-art results.",

            "abstract": "© 2015 IEEE.Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) offer high potential for enhancing training in many tasks, especially those that require maintaining high levels of concentration such as surgery. Training focus and attention can play a critical role in surgery since concentration on the task at hand is fundamental to prevent life-Threatening errors. In this paper we propose a new method for concentration training in the context of robot-Assisted laser microsurgery associated to a feedback design that makes the interaction more intuitive. This approach couples augmented reality (AR) features to both BCI-based on-line measurement of the user's mental focus and the control of the surgical robot. The methodology is described as a brain-controlled augmented reality (BcAR) training system. AR is used to maintain the surgeon's perceptual contact with the real operating setting, while focus stimulation is provided by modifying features of an AR item based on real-Time monitoring of the user's mental state. In this research a low-cost EEG device is used and the BcAR is implemented in the form of an AR scalpel that behaves as a \"retractable\" knife according to the user's mental focus: low concentration levels retract the knife and prevent cutting. This design provides directional compatibility between the AR feedback animation and the spontaneous motion of user's attention along the AR tool, resulting in an intuitive system with real impact on the training outcome. This is demonstrated through user trials and comparison with training based on simple AR feedback (no EEG). Results demonstrate the potential of the approach, showing a significant improvement in post-Training task execution time without any detriment to user experience. Subjective questionnaires also confirmed the critical role of directional compatibility in the AR feedback. Such findings allow the identification of further improvements and novel potential applications of this interaction paradigm.",

The development of high-resolution Fabry-Pérot interferometers has enabled a wide range of scientific and technological advances - ranging from the characterization of material properties to the more fundamental studies of quasiparticles in condensed matter. Spectral contrast is key to measuring weak signals and can reach a 103 peak-to-background ratio in a single-pass assembly. At its heart, this limit is a consequence of an unbalanced field amplitude across multiple interfering paths, with an ensuing reduced fringe visibility. Using a high-resolution, high-throughput virtually imaged phased array spectrometer, we demonstrate an intensity-equalization method to achieve an unprecedented 1000-fold increase in spectral contrast in a single-stage, single-pass configuration. To validate the system, we obtain the Brillouin spectrum of water at high scattering concentrations where, unlike with the standard scheme, the inelastic peaks are highly resolved. Our method brings the interferometer close to its ultimate limits and allows rapid high-resolution spectral analysis in a wide range of fields, including Brillouin spectroscopy, mechanical imaging, and molecular fingerprinting.",

The thickness of the considered microcrystalline silicon (μc-Si) layer is only ∼1/6 of conventional μc-Si based solar cells while the plasmonic nanoshells are formed by a combination of silica and gold, respectively core and shell. We analyze the cell optical response by varying both the geometrical and optical parameters of the overall device. In particular, the nanoshells core radius and metal thickness, the periodicity, the incident angle of the solar radiation and its wavelength are varied in the widest meaningful ranges. We further explain the reason for the absorption enhancement by calculating the electric field distribution associated to resonances of the device. We argue that both Fabry-Pérot-like and localized plasmon modes play an important role in this regard.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 American Chemical Society. Colloidal nanocrystals (NCs) are attractive materials for light-emitting applications thanks to their flexible synthesis, size-dependent properties, and bright emission. Yet, colloidal NCs still present a narrow gain band (full-width half-maximum around 10 nm), which limits their application to single-color lasers. Widening of the gain band by specifically engineered NCs can further improve the prospect of this class of materials toward the fabrication of solution-processed white-emitting or color-tunable lasers. Here, we report broadband amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) from wurtzite CdSe/CdS \"giant-shell\" nanocrystals (g-NCs) with an unprecedented large core up to 7.5 nm in diameter that were synthesized through a continuous injection route. The combination of large core and shell enables ASE from different CdSe optical transitions as well as from the CdS. Importantly, thin films of g-NCs with a large CdSe core (7.5 and 5.1 nm in diameter) show ASE at different colors with a similar threshold, indicating that light emission amplification can be achieved from different optical transitions simultaneously. Tuning of the core diameter allows obtaining ASE in a wide spectral range, and blending of g-NCs with different core sizes gives rise to a continuous amplified spontaneous emission band from green to red (510 to 650 nm). Drop-cast films of CdSe/CdS g-NCs demonstrate simultaneous dual-color random lasing under nanosecond-pulsed excitation.",

In this regime, transport is described by the Navier-Stokes equation, which contains two fundamental parameters, the bulk and shear viscosities. In this paper, we present extensive results for these transport coefficients in the case of the two-dimensional massless Dirac fermion liquid in a doped graphene sheet. Our approach relies on microscopic calculations of the viscosities up to second order in the strength of electron-electron interactions and in the high-frequency limit, where perturbation theory is applicable. We then use simple interpolation formulas that allow to reach the low-frequency hydrodynamic regime where perturbation theory is no longer directly applicable. The key ingredient for the interpolation formulas is the \"viscosity transport time\" τv, which we calculate in this paper. The transverse nature of the excitations contributing to τv leads to the suppression of scattering events with small momentum transfer, which are inherently longitudinal. Therefore, contrary to the quasiparticle lifetime, which goes as -1/[T2ln(T/TF)], in the low-temperature limit we find τv∼1/T2.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 Liska and Gozzi. Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) has consistently highlighted impaired or aberrant functional connectivity across brain regions of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) patients. However, the manifestation and neural substrates of these alterations are highly heterogeneous and often conflicting. Moreover, their neurobiological underpinnings and etiopathological significance remain largely unknown. A deeper understanding of the complex pathophysiological cascade leading to aberrant connectivity in ASD can greatly benefit from the use of model organisms where individual pathophysiological or phenotypic components of ASD can be recreated and investigated via approaches that are either off limits or confounded by clinical heterogeneity. Despite some obvious limitations in reliably modeling the full phenotypic spectrum of a complex developmental disorder like ASD, mouse models have played a central role in advancing our basic mechanistic and molecular understanding of this syndrome. Recent progress in mouse brain connectivity mapping via resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI) offers the opportunity to generate and test mechanistic hypotheses about the elusive origin and significance of connectional aberrations observed in autism. Here we discuss recent progress toward this goal, and illustrate initial examples of how the approach can be employed to establish causal links between ASD-related mutations, developmental processes, and brain connectional architecture. As the spectrum of genetic and pathophysiological components of ASD modeled in the mouse is rapidly expanding, the use of rsfMRI can advance our mechanistic understanding of the origin and significance of the connectional alterations associated with autism, and their heterogeneous expression across patient cohorts.",

Marijuana is a common name for the plant Cannabis sativa, whose intoxicating and medicinal effects have been known for thousand of years. The active principle of marijuana, (-)-trans-Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC), exerts its pharmacological effects by binding to selective receptors present on the membranes of neurons and other cells. These cannabinoid receptors are normally engaged by a family of lipid mediators, called endocannabinoids, which are thought to participate in the regulation of a diversity of brain functions, including pain, mood, appetite and memory. The endocannabinoid system is comprised of the endocannabinoids, mainly anandamide (arachidonoylethanolamide) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), proteins that control their formation and deactivation, and cell-surface receptors (CB1 and CB2) that transduce their actions. The key components of endocannabinoid signaling are found in the brain and spinal cord, but also in many peripheral organs and tissues. In this chapter, we outline current views on how endocannabinoid substances are produced, act on cannabinoid receptors, and are deactivated in the brain. In addition, we review recent progress on the development of pharmacological agents that interfere with endocannabinoid deactivation and discuss their potential utility in the treatment of cannabinoid-based therapeutics.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 American Chemical Society. The endogenous dipeptide l-carnosine, and its derivative homocarnosine, prevent and reduce several pathologies like amytrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease. Their beneficial action is severely hampered because of the hydrolysis by carnosinase enzymes, in particular the human carnosinase, hCN1. This belongs to the metallopeptidase M20 family, where a cocatalytic active site is formed by two Zn2+ ions, bridged by a hydroxide anion. The protein may exist as a monomer and as a dimer in vivo. Here we used hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics simulations based on the dimeric apoenzyme's structural information to predict the Michaelis complexes with l-carnosine and its derivative homocarnosine. On the basis of our calculations, we suggest that (i) l-carnosine degradation occurs through a nucleophilic attack of a Zn2+-coordinated bridging moiety for both monomer and dimer. This mechanistic hypothesis for hCN1 catalysis differs from previous proposals, while it is in agreement with available experimental data. (ii) The experimentally measured higher affinity of homocarnosine for the enzyme relative to l-carnosine might be explained, at least in part, by more extensive interactions inside the monomeric and dimeric hCN1's active site. (iii) Hydrogen bonds at the binding site, present in the dimer but absent in the monomer, might play a role in the experimentally observed higher activity of the dimeric form. Investigations of the enzymatic reaction are required to establish or disprove this hypothesis. Our results may serve as a basis for the design of potent hCN1 inhibitors.",

One of the greatest attributes of metal halide perovskite solar cells is their surprisingly low loss in potential between bandgap and open-circuit voltage, despite the fact that they suffer from a non-negligible density of sub gap defect states. Here, we use a combination of transient and steady state photocurrent and absorption spectroscopy to show that CH3NH3PbI3 films exhibit a broad distribution of electron traps. We show that the trapped electrons recombine with free holes unexpectedly slowly, on microsecond time scales, relaxing the limit on obtainable open-circuit voltage (VOC) under trap-mediated recombination conditions. We find that the observed VOCs in such perovskite solar cells can only be rationalized by considering the slow trap mediated recombination mechanism identified in this work. Our results suggest that existing processing routes may be good enough to enable open circuit voltages approaching 1.3 V in ideal devices with perfect contacts.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 American Chemical Society. Au-catalyzed III-V nanowire heterostructures based on the group III interchange usually grow straight only in one of the two growth sequences, whereas the other sequence produces kinked geometries; thus, the realization of double heterostructures remains challenging. Here, we investigate the growth of Au-assisted InAs-GaAs and GaAs-InAs axial nanowire heterostructures. A detailed study of the heterostructure morphology as a function of growth parameters and chemical composition of the catalyst nanoparticle is performed by means of scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and energy-dispersive X-ray analysis. Our results clearly demonstrate that the nanoparticle composition, rather than other growth parameters, as postulated so far, controls the growth mode and the resulting nanowire morphology. Although GaAs easily grows straight on InAs, straight growth of InAs on GaAs is achieved only if the nanoparticle composition is properly tuned. We find that straight InAs segments on GaAs require high group III-to-Au ratios in the nanoparticle (greater than 0.8); otherwise, the droplet wets the sidewalls and the nanowire kinks. We discuss the observed behavior within a theoretical model that relates the nanoparticle stability to the group III-to-Au ratio. Based on this finding, we demonstrate the growth of straight nanowire heterostructures for both sequences. The proposed strategy can be extended to other III-V nanowire heterostructures based on the group III interchange, allowing for straight morphology regardless of the growth sequence, and ultimately for designing nanowire heterostructures with the required properties for different applications.",

In the present work, ceria, ceria-zirconia (Ce = 80 at.%, Zr = 20 at.%), ceria praseodymia (Ce = 80 at.%, Pr = 20 at.%) and ceria-zirconia-praseodymia catalysts (Ce = 80 at.%, Zr = 10 at.% and Pr = 10 at.%) have been prepared by the multi-inlet vortex reactor (MIVR). For each set of samples, two inlet flow rates have been used during the synthesis (namely, 2 ml min−1 , and 20 ml min−1) in order to obtain different particle sizes. Catalytic activity of the prepared materials has been investigated for CO and soot oxidation reactions. As a result, when the catalysts exhibit similar crystallite sizes (in the 7.7–8.8 nm range), it is possible to observe a direct correlation between the Ov/F2g vibrational band intensity ratios and the catalytic performance for the CO oxidation. This means that structural (superficial) defects play a key role for this process. The incorporation of Zr and Pr species into the ceria lattice increases the population of structural defects, as measured by Raman spectroscopy, according to the order: CeO2 &lt; Ce80Zr20 &lt; Ce80Zr10Pr10 &lt; Ce80Pr20. On the other hand, the presence of zirconium and praseodymium into the ceria lattice does not have a direct beneficial effect on the soot oxidation activity for these catalysts, in contrast with nanostructured ones (e.g., Ce–Zr–O nanopolyhedra, Ce–Pr–O nanocubes) described elsewhere (Andana et al. Appl. Catal. B 197: 125–137, 2016; Piumetti et al., Appl Catal B 180: 271-282, 2016).",

L1 (also known as L1CAM) is a trans-membrane glycoprotein mediating neuron-neuron adhesion through homophilic and heterophilic interactions. Although experimental evidence has implicated L1 in axonal outgrowth, fasciculation and pathfinding, its contribution to voltage-gated Na+ channel function and membrane excitability has remained unknown. Here, we show that firing rate, single cell spiking frequency and Na+ current density are all reduced in hippocampal excitatory neurons from L1-deficient mice both in culture and in slices owing to an overall reduced membrane expression of Na+ channels. Remarkably, normal firing activity was restored when L1 was reintroduced into L1-deficient excitatory neurons, indicating that abnormal firing patterns are not related to developmental abnormalities, but are a direct consequence of L1 deletion. Moreover, L1 deficiency leads to impairment of action potential initiation, most likely due to the loss of the interaction of L1 with ankyrin G that produces the delocalization of Na+ channels at the axonal initial segment. We conclude that L1 contributes to functional expression and localization of Na+ channels to the neuronal plasma membrane, ensuring correct initiation of action potential and normal firing activity.",

            "abstract": "© 2015 Elsevier Ltd. Cells activate signalling through ligand-receptor bonds by sensing the mechanical properties of the surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM). Ligands, indeed, have to withstand the pulling force elicited by cell receptors through focal adhesions (FAs). On this basis, we developed functional ligands to be simply adsorbed on surfaces and constituted by a two-domain peptide: one derived from ECM proteins and available to receptors to offer biochemical cues, and another adsorbed on material to withstand the tension upon receptor engagement. Tuneable compliance of the anchoring domain of the peptide ligand was verified by single peptide analysis through molecular dynamics and adsorption measurements. We showed that the highest adsorbed peptides combined with integrin cell-binding motifs allow for the cell recognition and polarization with larger mature FA areas. On the contrary, the lowest adsorbed sequences did not provide mechanical resistance to the integrin pulling action, leading to more rounded cells with smaller FA areas. This evidence demonstrates that cell mechanosensory can discriminate ligands on surfaces and should be considered as a criterion in ligand design for material bioactivation.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 Royal Society of Chemistry.Bio-nanomaterials offer promise in the field of tissue engineering. Specifically, environmental cues such as the material chemistry, topography and rigidity of the surface to which cells adhere to, can alter and dictate cell shape, proliferation, migration, and gene expression. How deeply each factor (topographical, chemical and mechanical) drives cell response remains incompletely understood. To illustrate cell sensitivities to different factors, we herein present ZnO nanorods (ZnO-Nrds) coated on glass and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrates and analyzed cell viability and proliferation. The work presented here shows a clear response of various cell lines (mouse embryonic fibroblasts 3T3, human cervix carcinoma HeLa and human osteoblast-like cells MG63) to the rigidity of the underlying surface. The chemical counterpart, given by the presence of ZnO-Nrds, strongly reduced the cell viability of all cell lines. However, the substrate underlying the ZnO coating impacted cell spreading and viability. The substrates exhibited a better ability to neglect cell attachment and proliferation with the ZnO coating and pro-apoptoticity specifically with the PDMS as the underlying substrate which exhibited a \"softer\" environment with respect to a glass substrate. The results also revealed that the few cells that adhered to the ZnO-Nrds on PDMS and glass showed a rounded morphology. On the basis of these observations, we can correlate common features of phenomenological cell response to chemotactic and durotactic cues. The work presented herein reinforces the response of cells to changes in substrate rigidity. These observations provide a foundation for a potentially promising approach to decrease cell adhesion and thus as an optimal substrate for different applications such as prosthesis design, tissue engineering, anti-bio fouling materials and diagnostics.",

            "abstract": "Central tendency, the tendency of judgements of quantities (lengths, durations etc.) to gravitate towards their mean, is one of the most robust perceptual effects. A Bayesian account has recently suggested that central tendency reflects the integration of noisy sensory estimates with prior knowledge representations of a mean stimulus, serving to improve performance. The process is flexible, so prior knowledge is weighted more heavily when sensory estimates are imprecise, requiring more integration to reduce noise. In this study we measure central tendency in autism to evaluate a recent theoretical hypothesis suggesting that autistic perception relies less on prior knowledge representations than typical perception. If true, autistic children should show reduced central tendency than theoretically predicted from their temporal resolution. We tested autistic and age-and ability-matched typical children in two child-friendly tasks: (1) a time interval reproduction task, measuring central tendency in the temporal domain; and (2) a time discrimination task, assessing temporal resolution. Central tendency reduced with age in typical development, while temporal resolution improved. Autistic children performed far worse in temporal discrimination than the matched controls. Computational simulations suggested that central tendency was much less in autistic children than predicted by theoretical modelling, given their poor temporal resolution.",

In this regard, lithium metal batteries, due to their very high electrochemical energy storage capacity, appear to be a highly appealing choice. Unfortunately, the use of lithium metal as the anode may lead to some safety hazards due to its uneven deposition upon charging, resulting in dendrite growth and eventual shorting of the battery. This issue may be successfully addressed by using intrinsically safer electrolytes capable of establishing a physical barrier at the electrode interface. The most promising candidates are solid electrolytes, either polymeric or inorganic. The main purpose of this review is to describe the present status of worldwide research on these electrolyte materials together with a critical discussion of their transport properties and compatibility with metallic lithium, hoping to provide some general guidelines for the development of innovative and safe lithium metal batteries.",

Digital image correlation (DIC) is an optical technique for contactless displacement and strain measurement recently applied to biological tissues. We characterized a DIC system for small biological specimens based on a high speed camera, a stereomicroscope, and an original image correlation algorithm. Optical features have been evaluated calculating the optical distortion and the modulation transfer function. The accuracy of the DIC algorithm used here has been assessed employing an elastic specimen subjected to known amount of strains, and has been compared with accuracies obtained in the same way using two other algorithms. For strain values up to 25 %, that is within the typical strain range for biological tissues, and for magnifications up to 6.3×, our DIC algorithm was able to compute strains with a relative error lower than 1 %. The accuracies obtained with the elastic specimen were then confirmed performing DIC analysis on mouse skin samples subjected to controlled strains.",

First, the biophysical and surface properties are characterized; then, the long-term biocompatibility is assessed after implantation of the organic device in the subretinal space of 3-months-old rats for a period of five months. The results indicate a good stability of the subretinal implants over time, with preservation of the physical properties of the polymeric layer and a tight contact with the outer retina. Immunoinflammatory markers detect only a modest tissue reaction to the surgical insult and the foreign body that peaks shortly after surgery and progressively decreases with time to normal levels at five months after implantation. Importantly, the integrity of the polymeric layer in direct contact with the retinal tissue is preserved after five months of implantation. The recovery of the foreign-body tissue reaction is also associated with a normal b-wave in the electroretinographic response. The results demonstrate that the device implanted in nondystrophic eyes is well tolerated, highly biocompatible, and suitable as retinal prosthesis in case of photoreceptor degeneration.",

The development of optical fabrication tools such as direct laser writing (DLW) lithography provides an unprecedented ability to rapidly generate arbitrary structures with control down to the nanoscale. Key to the further advance of these strategies is the development of simple and straightforward methods to monitor or characterize the fabricated structures. Here, we use a two-beam approach based on the reversible saturable optical fluorescence transition (RESOLFT) concept that enables the fabrication as well as the rapid characterization of nanometer-sized DLW lithography structures since both steps can be performed in the same experimental system. Our two-step approach uses two-beam DLW lithography based on the triplet state absorption (TSA) mechanism to polymerize a resist containing isopropyl thioxanthone (ITX) as the photoinitiator and Chromeo 488 carboxylic acid derivative as a fluorescent reporter, and then stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy to rapidly characterize the size and morphology of the polymerized structures after the development of the sample. Our results show photopolymerized lines with a linewidth of ~90 nm whose size was properly determined with STED microscopy.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 IEEE. Elastography imaging is a promising technique to non-invasively assess the mechanical properties of biological tissues. Characterization of the non-linear elastic behavior of soft tissues represents a promising challenge in this field. The strain hardening effect of tissues with the increase of the applied load is already known, but up to today, few quantitative data of this effect exist in literature. This study aimed at revealing the elastic properties of ex-vivo mouse tissues and at characterizing their non-linear elastic behavior. This was done using a dedicated indentation experimental system that measured the length of each sample under a controlled force. Three mouse tissue specimens were studied: a Tibialis Anterior (TA) muscle, an Extensor Digitorum Longus (EDL) muscle and an adipose tissue sample. The investigation of the stress-strain curve reconstructed from experimental data revealed that TA, EDL and fat tissues showed a linear elasticity for strains up to 3.05%, 8.2% and 9.2% respectively. The non-linear region of the curve was found to be exponential, showing that TA muscle exhibited a strain hardening effect higher than EDL muscle and adipose tissue. The present study provided biomechanical models allowing to estimate the Young's modulus of the specimens as a function of the strains at a specific stress profile. Our preliminary results suggest the validity of these models in describing the non-linear stress-strain relationship of tissues. This allows a proper interpretation of elastograms obtained through large compression and/or pre-compression and helps in preventing misdiagnosis. Further investigations are needed to confirm this preliminary evidence.",

Here we investigate charge carrier generation and extraction processes in hybrid polymer/nanocrystal solar cells by means of time-resolved optical and photoelectrical techniques. We addressed the role of both poly(3-hexylthiophene) and colloidal arenethiolate-capped PbS quantum dots, which constitute the hybrid composite nanomaterial, in the photoinduced processes most relevant to device operation by changing the compositional ratio and applying chemical and thermal postdeposition treatments. The carrier generation processes were found to be wavelength-dependent: excitons generated in the polymer domains led to long-lived weakly bound charge pairs upon electron transfer to PbS nanocrystals; whereas charge carrier generation in the nanocrystal domains is highly efficient, although effective separation required the application of external electric field. Overall, charge carrier generation was found efficient and almost independent of the strength of applied electric field; therefore, competition between separation of electron-hole pairs into free carriers and geminate recombination is the major factor limiting the fill factor of nanocomposite-based solar cells. Device efficiency improvements thus require faster interfacial charge transfer processes, which are deeply related to the refinement of nanocrystal surface chemistry.",

Chitosan is a polymer exceptionally versatile, biodegradable, biocompatible and with good capacity of mucoadhesivity and permeation-enhancing effect. These features make chitosan a perfect material for the fabrication of polymeric nanoparticles for a variety of applications in the field of pharmaceutics, nutraceutics or cosmetics. This paper discuss on the role of isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) in the creation of protocols for the preparation of chitosan-based nanoparticles, as well as the role of calorimetry to find chitosan-coating conditions to offer to nanoparticles the desired proprieties for the delivery of drugs, biologics and vaccines. Although several papers of the current literature show the employment of ITC in chitosan-based nanosystems, most of them lack a thermodynamic description. Here, we highlight on two types of systems: chitosan-coating nanoparticles and chitosan-containing nanoparticles. The thermodynamic properties and the energetic aspects of the overall interactions are discussed.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd.Objective. Drug resistant focal epilepsy can be treated by resecting the epileptic focus requiring a precise focus localisation using stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) probes. As commercial SEEG probes offer only a limited spatial resolution, probes of higher channel count and design freedom enabling the incorporation of macro and microelectrodes would help increasing spatial resolution and thus open new perspectives for investigating mechanisms underlying focal epilepsy and its treatment. This work describes a new fabrication process for SEEG probes with materials and dimensions similar to clinical probes enabling recording single neuron activity at high spatial resolution. Approach. Polyimide is used as a biocompatible flexible substrate into which platinum electrodes and leads are integrated with a minimal feature size of 5 μm. The polyimide foils are rolled into the cylindrical probe shape at a diameter of 0.8 mm. The resulting probe features match those of clinically approved devices. Tests in saline solution confirmed the probe stability and functionality. Probes were implanted into the brain of one monkey (Macaca mulatta), trained to perform different motor tasks. Suitable configurations including up to 128 electrode sites allow the recording of task-related neuronal signals. Main results. Probes with 32 and 64 electrode sites were implanted in the posterior parietal cortex. Local field potentials and multi-unit activity were recorded as early as one hour after implantation. Stable single-unit activity was achieved for up to 26 days after implantation of a 64-channel probe. All recorded signals showed modulation during task execution. Significance. With the novel probes it is possible to record stable biologically relevant data over a time span exceeding the usual time needed for epileptic focus localisation in human patients. This is the first time that single units are recorded along cylindrical polyimide probes chronically implanted 22 mm deep into the brain of a monkey, which suggests the potential usefulness of this probe for human applications.",

Methods: Blood alcohol concentration (BAC) data were collected from drivers involved in traffic accidents during one year in an Italian region and in a control group of drivers over the same road network. Mean circadian sleep propensity was estimated from a previous study as function of time of day. Accident risk was analyzed by logistic regression as function of BAC and circadian sleep propensity. Results: BAC values greater than zero were found in 72.0% of the drivers involved in crashes and in 40.4% of the controls. Among the former 23.6% of the drivers exceeded the BAC legal threshold of 0.05 g/dL, while illegal values were found in 10.4% of the controls. The relative risk showed a significant increase with both BAC and circadian sleep propensity (as estimated from time of day) and their interaction was significant. Conclusions: Due to the significant interaction, even low BAC levels strongly increased accident risk when associated with high sleep propensity.",

In this paper, we present a study on peculiar plant root movements, named circumnutations, adopted by plants as an efficient strategy to penetrate the soil and implemented in robotic roots to improve their performance in exploration tasks. The robotic root is able to bend and interact with soil owing to a soft actuation mechanism based on the translation of rotary to linear motion by means of helical compression springs. The robotic root integrates a stimulus-oriented behavior combined with circumnutation movements, which leads to an extraordinarily large reduction (more than 80 times) of the force needed for penetration in artificial soil (sawdust) while performing circumnutations with respect to a straightforward movement.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 Palumbo et al. Background: Nitrobenzoxadiazole derivatives (NBDs), including NBDHEX and the recently developed MC3181, are promising anticancer agents able to target glutathione transferase and inhibit both its catalytic activity and ability to sequester TNF-receptor associated factor 2 (TRAF2) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). NBDs have been shown to impair the growth and survival of a broad-spectrum of tumor types, in vitro and in vivo. Herein, we evaluated the effects of the new compound MC3181 on U-2OS osteosarcoma cells and investigated the impact of both NBDHEX and MC3181 on autophagy. Methods: Cell viability was evaluated by sulforhodamine B assay. The dissociation of the TRAF2-GSTP1-1 complex was detected by proximity ligation assay, while the phospho-activation of JNK was assessed by western blotting. The effects of NBDs on autophagy were evaluated by GFP-LC3 puncta formation, western blotting for LC3-II and p62, and LC3 turnover assay in the presence of bafilomycin A1. The role of JNK in the reduction of autophagic flux caused by NBDs was investigated using JNK1 shRNA-transfected cells. Fluorogenic caspase activity assay and flow cytometric analysis of DNA content were used to determine the cytotoxic effects of NBDs on JNK1-silenced cells. Results: Similar to NBDHEX, MC3181 reduced viability and activated TRAF2/JNK signaling in U-2OS cells. Moreover, NBDs induced the accumulation of autophagic vesicles and LC3-II while reducing both basal and nutritional stress-induced autophagic flux. Furthermore, increased levels of both LC3-II and the autophagy selective substrate p62 were observed in different tumor cell lines treated with NBDs, the concurrent increase of these markers being consistent with an impairment of autophagosome clearance. Autophagy inhibition by NBDs required JNK activity: NBDs caused autophagy inhibition and caspase-3 activation in JNK-positive U-2OS, but no autophagic flux inhibition or caspase-3 activation in JNK-silenced cells. Conclusions: Our demonstration that NBDs can act as late-phase autophagy inhibitors opens new opportunities to fully exploit their therapeutic potential. This may not rely solely on their effectiveness in inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, but also on their ability to weaken the capacity of tumor cells to endure stress conditions via autophagy. In addition, this study provides evidence that JNK can participate in impairing autophagy.",

TBC1D24-related disorders include a wide phenotypic ranging from mild to lethal seizure disorders, non-syndromic deafness, and composite syndromes such as DOORS (deafness, onychodystrophy, osteodystrophy, mental retardation, and seizures). The TBC1D24 gene has a role in cerebral cortex development and in presynaptic neurotransmission. Here, we present a familial case of a lethal early-onset epileptic encephalopathy, associated with two novel compound heterozygous missense variants on the TBC1D24 gene, which were detected by exome sequencing. The detailed clinical data of the three siblings is summarized in order to support the variability of the phenotype, severity, and progression of this disorder among these family members. Functional studies demonstrated that the identified novel missense mutations result in a loss of expression of the protein, suggesting a correlation between residual expression, and the disease severity. This indicates that protein expression analysis is important for interpreting genetic results when novel variants are found, as well as for complementing clinical assessment by predicting the functional impact. Further analysis is necessary to delineate the clinical presentation of individuals with TBC1D24 pathogenic variants, as well as to develop markers for diagnosis, prognosis, and potential targeted treatments. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Our segmentation proposes visually and semantically coherent image segments. We use binary encoding of CNN features to overcome the difficulty of the clustering on the high-dimensional CNN feature space. These binary codes are very robust against noise and non-semantic changes in the image. These binary encoding can be embedded into the CNN as an extra layer at the end of the network. This results in real-time segmentation. To the best of our knowledge our method is the first attempt on general semantic image segmentation using CNN. All the previous papers were limited to few number of category of the images (e.g. PASCAL VOC). Experiments show that our segmentation algorithm outperform the state-of-the-art non-semantic segmentation methods by large margin.",

In this work, Co2+ and Ho3+ doped CuS nanostructured assemblies have been synthesized by means of a surfactant free hydrothermal method and investigated as photocatalysts in the degradation of methylene blue (MB) dye under visible light irradiation in the presence of H2O2. Firstly, it is found that the nature of dopants (M = Co2+, Ho3+) plays an important role in controlling the morphology of CuS structures as observed in FESEM and TEM analysis. Secondly, the band gap values of the M doped CuS structures showed a red shift. As a result, the M doped CuS structures exhibited enhanced photocatalytic activities compared to the pristine CuS structures. Among the different photocatalysts tested, 2.5 mol% cobalt doped CuS (CC samples) showed the best activity (∼52% more than CuS) in the photocatalytic degradation of dyes (almost complete degradation (∼99%) of MB dye in 20 min). In addition, these CC samples showed good catalyst stability for the degradation of dyes. The overall differences in the catalytic activity of the samples tested are discussed in terms of their band gap, surface area, porosity, defect surface, and morphology.",

Absorption in aqueous amine solutions is the most advanced technology for the capture of CO2, although suffering from drawbacks that do not allow exploitation on large scale. The search for optimum solvents has been pursued with empirical methods and has also motivated a number of computational approaches over the last decade. However, a deeper level of understanding of the relevant chemical reactions in solution is required so as to contribute to this effort. We present here a brief critical overview of the most recent applications of computer simulations using ab initio methods. Comparison of their outcome shows a strong dependence on the structural models employed to represent the molecular systems in solution and on the strategy used to simulate the reactions. In particular, the results of very recent ab initio molecular dynamics augmented with metadynamics are summarized, showing the crucial role of water, which has been so far strongly underestimated both in the calculations and in the interpretation of experimental data. Indications are given for advances in computational approaches that are necessary if meant to contribute to the rational design of new solvents.",

However, over the past few decades, new classes of solution-processable CTMs have evolved alongside new concepts for fabricating electronic devices at low cost and with exceptional properties. The vast majority of these novel materials are organic compounds and the use of transition metal complexes in electronic applications remains largely unexplored. Here, a solution-processable solid-state charge transport material composed of a blend of [Co(bpyPY4)](OTf)2 and Co(bpyPY4)](OTf)3 where bpyPY4 is the hexadentate ligand 6,6′-bis(1,1-di(pyridin-2-yl)ethyl)-2,2′-bipyridine and OTf− is the trifluoromethanesulfonate anion is reported. Surprisingly, these films exhibit a negative temperature coefficient of conductivity (dσ/dT) and non-Arrhenius behavior, with respectable solid-state conductivities of 3.0 S m−1 at room temperature and 7.4 S m−1 at 4.5 K. When employed as a CTM in a solid-state dye-sensitized solar cell, these largely amorphous, transparent films afford impressive solar energy conversion efficiencies of up to 5.7%. Organic–inorganic hybrid materials with negative temperature coefficients of conductivity generally feature extended flat π-systems with strong π–π interactions or high crystallinity. The lack of these features promotes [Co(bpyPY4)](OTf)2+ x films as a new class of CTMs with a unique charge transport mechanism that remains to be explored.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 American Chemical Society. We describe the colloidal hot-injection synthesis of phase-pure nanocrystals (NCs) of a highly abundant mineral, chalcopyrite (CuFeS2). Absorption bands centered at around 480 and 950 nm, spanning almost the entire visible and near-infrared regions, encompass their optical extinction characteristics. These peaks are ascribable to electronic transitions from the valence band (VB) to the empty intermediate band (IB), located in the fundamental gap and mainly composed of Fe 3d orbitals. Laser-irradiation (at 808 nm) of an aqueous suspension of CuFeS2 NCs exhibited significant heating, with a photothermal conversion efficiency of 49%. Such efficient heating is ascribable to the carrier relaxation within the broad IB band (owing to the indirect VB-IB gap), as corroborated by transient absorption measurements. The intense absorption and high photothermal transduction efficiency (PTE) of these NCs in the so-called biological window (650-900 nm) make them suitable for photothermal therapy as demonstrated by tumor cell annihilation upon laser irradiation. The otherwise harmless nature of these NCs in dark conditions was confirmed by in vitro toxicity tests on two different cell lines. The presence of the deep Fe levels constituting the IB is the origin of such enhanced PTE, which can be used to design other high performing NC photothermal agents.",

Drug-resistance to chemotherapics in aggressive neuroblastoma (NB) is characterized by enhanced cell survival mediated by TrkB and its ligand, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF); thus reduction in BDNF levels represent a promising strategy to overcome drugresistance, but how chemotherapics regulate BDNF is unknown. Here, cisplatin treatment in SK-N-BE neuroblastoma upregulated multiple BDNF transcripts, except exons 5 and 8 variants. Cisplatin increased BDNF mRNA and protein, and enhanced translation of a firefly reporter gene flanked by BDNF 5?UTR exons 1, 2c, 4 or 6 and 3?UTR-long. To block BDNF translation we focused on aurora kinases inhibitors which are proposed as new chemotherapeutics. NB cell survival after 24 h treatment was 43% with cisplatin, and 22% by cisplatin+aurora kinase inhibitor PHA-680632, while the aurora kinases inhibitor alone was less effective; however the combined treatment induced a paradoxical increase of BDNF in surviving cells with strong translational activation of exon6-3?UTR-long transcript, while translation of BDNF transcripts 1, 2C and 4 was suppressed. In conclusion, combined cisplatin and aurora kinase inhibitor treatment increases cell death, but induces BDNF overproduction in surviving cells through an aurora kinase-independent mechanism.",

Few-layer graphene films were grown by chemical vapor deposition and transferred onto n-type crystalline silicon wafers to fabricate graphene/n-silicon Schottky barrier solar cells. In order to increase the power conversion efficiency of such cells the graphene films were doped with nitric acid vapor and an antireflection treatment was implemented to reduce the sunlight reflection on the top of the device. The doping process increased the work function of the graphene film and had a beneficial effect on its conductivity. The deposition of a double antireflection coating led to an external quantum efficiency up to 90% across the visible and near infrared region, the highest ever reported for this type of devices. The combined effect of graphene doping and antireflection treatment allowed to reach a power conversion efficiency of 8.5% exceeding the pristine (undoped and uncoated) device performance by a factor of 4. The optical properties of the antireflection coating were found to be not affected by the exposure to nitric acid vapor and to remain stable over time.",

One of the main challenges in this setting is to understand the role of different sensory modalities (namely proprioception, object weight from F/T sensors and touch) and how to combine them to correctly discriminate different objects. We investigated these aspects by considering multiple sensory channels and different exploratory strategies to gather meaningful information regarding the object's physical properties. We propose a novel strategy to train a learning machine able to efficiently combine sensory modalities by first learning individual object features and then combine them in a single classifier. To evaluate our approach and compare it with previous methods we collected a dataset for haptic object recognition, comprising 11 objects that were held in the hands of the iCub robot while performing different exploration strategies. Results show that our strategy consistently outperforms previous approaches [17].",

Unfortunately, the lack of standardized stimulus sets has so far limited the use of this technique for studying social interaction. Here, we describe a new tool to study the interaction between two agents starting from point-light displays: the Communicative Interaction Database - 5AFC format (CID-5). The CID-5 consists of 14 communicative and seven non-communicative individual actions performed by two agents. Stimuli were constructed by combining motion capture techniques and 3-D animation software to provide precise control over the computer-generated actions. For each action stimulus, we provide coordinate files and movie files depicting the action as seen from four different perspectives. Furthermore, the archive contains a text file with a list of five alternative action descriptions to construct forced-choice paradigms. In order to validate the CID-5 format, we provide normative data collected to assess action identification within a 5AFC tasks. The CID-5 archive is freely downloadable from http://bsb-lab.org/research/ and from the supplementary materials of this article.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 The Author(s) Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating neurological disease with no effective treatment available. An increasing number of genetic causes of ALS are being identified, but how these genetic defects lead to motor neuron degeneration and to which extent they affect common cellular pathways remains incompletely understood. To address these questions, we performed an interactomic analysis to identify binding partners of wild-type (WT) and ALS-associated mutant versions of ATXN2, C9orf72, FUS, OPTN, TDP-43 and UBQLN2 in neuronal cells. This analysis identified several known but also many novel binding partners of these proteins. Interactomes of WT and mutant ALS proteins were very similar except for OPTN and UBQLN2, in which mutations caused loss or gain of protein interactions. Several of the identified interactomes showed a high degree of overlap: shared binding partners of ATXN2, FUS and TDP-43 had roles in RNA metabolism; OPTN- and UBQLN2-interacting proteins were related to protein degradation and protein transport, and C9orf72 interactors function in mitochondria. To confirm that this overlap is important for ALS pathogenesis, we studied fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), one of the common interactors of ATXN2, FUS and TDP-43, in more detail in in vitro and in vivo model systems for FUS ALS. FMRP localized to mutant FUS-containing aggregates in spinal motor neurons and bound endogenous FUS in a direct and RNA-sensitive manner. Furthermore, defects in synaptic FMRP mRNA target expression, neuromuscular junction integrity, and motor behavior caused by mutant FUS in zebrafish embryos, could be rescued by exogenous FMRP expression. Together, these results show that interactomics analysis can provide crucial insight into ALS disease mechanisms and they link FMRP to motor neuron dysfunction caused by FUS mutations.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 IEEE. This contribution compares two approaches for applying disturbance observers (DOBs) to the torque control problem of series elastic actuators (SEAs). It is demonstrated that they are in fact equivalent for linear models in terms of their ability to reject disturbances and enforce nominal model dynamics. The closed loop and error transfer functions for the DOBbased approaches are compared to a fully linear plant and a nonlinear plant without DOB. Simulations demonstrate that the DOBs are able to increase the bandwidth of the nonlinear plant significantly, up to that of the linear plant. Furthermore, the DOBs significantly increase the tracking accuracy at low frequencies.",

            "abstract": "© Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016. The ability of focusing on a single conversation in the middle of a crowded environment is usually referred at as the cocktail party effect. This skill exploits binaural cues and spectral features of a target speaker. Unfortunately, traditional acoustic prostheses tend to modify these cues in ways that the brain cannot recover. Social isolation is an inevitable consequence. In this work we tested the Glassense, an intelligent pair of glasses. Binaural input from microphones arrays is processed to spatially segregate the soundscape surrounding the listener, so that frontal speech sources are preserved, while competing sources from the sides and the back are attenuated, just as an “acoustical lens”. We report an increase in speech intelligibility by about 4 dB, measured as reception threshold, under severe noisy conditions. Our device can be a complementary input to existing acoustic prostheses, aimed at increasing spatial awareness of persons affected by partial hearing loss.",

In this paper, the estimation of the terrain inclination is improved for walking in place on an inclination-varying slope. A passivity based admittance control utilizes the force/torque sensing in feet to actively regulate the impedance at the center of mass to stabilize the robot. The logic-based inclination estimation algorithm uses the feet to probe the terrain and deals with the under-actuation. The equilibrium set-point in the admittance control is regulated based on the detected inclination. The effectiveness of the control framework is validated on the humanoid robot COMAN and demonstrated by estimating the terrain inclination, coping with the under-actuation phase, adapting to the slope with changing inclination during both standing and walking. Experimental data are analyzed and discussed, and the future work is suggested.",

Their outstanding properties have been used in the development of CNT-polymer composites as possible alternative materials for various applications, such as flexible electrodes, antistatic coatings and piezoresistive sensors. In our study we focused our attention on the evaluation and modelling of CNT-filled epoxy resin electrical conductivity. We discuss the results with regard to the influence of CNTs dimensions and content. Exploiting the Dijkstra algorithm, we implemented a simulation code which determines the shortest route between electrodes in the polymer. The longer the path inside the polymer, the more non-conductive the composite becomes, since polymer resistivity is orders of magnitude higher than that of CNTs. We compared these simulated results with experimental data obtained at several wt% and found a good correspondence between modelling and experimental results.",

Lattice vibrational modes in cadmium chalcogenide nanocrystals (NCs) have a strong impact on the carrier dynamics of excitons in such confined systems and on the optical properties of these nanomaterials. A prominent material for light emitting applications are CdSe/CdS core-shell dot-in-rods. Here we present a detailed investigation of the acoustic phonon modes in such dot-in-rods by nonresonant Raman spectroscopy with laser excitation energy lower than their bandgap. With high signal-to-noise ratio in the frequency range from 5-50 cm-1, we reveal distinct Raman bands that can be related to confined extensional and radial-breathing modes (RBM). Comparison of the experimental results with finite elements simulation and analytical analysis gives detailed insight into the localized nature of the acoustic vibration modes and their resonant frequencies. In particular, the RBM of dot-in-rods cannot be understood by an oscillation of a CdSe sphere embedded in a CdS rod matrix. Instead, the dot-in-rod architecture leads to a reduction of the sound velocity in the core region of the rod, which results in a redshift of the rod RBM frequency and localization of the phonon induced strain in vicinity of the core where optical transitions occur. Such localized effects potentially can be exploited as a tool to tune exciton-phonon coupling in nanocrystal heterostructures.",

Nowadays, microfluidic channels of a few tens of micrometers are required and widely used in many fields, especially for surface-processing applications and miniaturization of biological assays. Herein, we selected micromilling as a low-cost technology and proposed an approach capable of overcoming its limitations; in fact, microstructures below 20-30 m in depth are difficult to obtain, and the manufacturing error is rather high, as it is inversely proportional to the depth. Indeed, the proposed method uses a confined dehydration process of a patterned gelatin substrate fabricated via replica molding onto a micromilled poly(methyl methacrylate) substrate to produce a gelatin master with demonstrated final micrometric features down to 3 m for the channel depth and, in specific configurations, down to 5 m for the channel width. Finally, we demonstrated the ability to flux liquids in miniaturized microfluidic devices and fabricated and tested - as an example - micrometric microstructures arrays connected via microchannels for biological assays.",

The possibility to optically excite the electrical activity of living cells by using exogenous absorbers is gaining more and more interest in the neuroscience and biotechnology community. Conjugated polymers, inherently sensitive to visible light, were recently proposed as candidates to this goal. To date, however, only one polymer type, namely regio-regular poly-3-hexylthiophene, has been tested as the active material. In this work four different conjugated polymers, regarded as prototypes of their category, are investigated as photoactive bio-interfaces. The selected materials have different absorption spectra, morphology, light emission efficiency and charge transport properties. We analyze their key-enabling properties, such as electrochemical stability, surface morphology, wettability, sterilization compatibility, interaction with protein adhesion layers and toxicity, throughout all the necessary steps for the realization of an efficient bio-optical interface. We demonstrate that all considered polymers are characterized by good biocompatibility and cell seeding properties, and can optimally sustain thermal sterilization. Conversely, electrochemical stability and cell photostimulation efficacy can vary a lot among different materials, and should be carefully evaluated case by case. Reported results represent the starting point for the implementation of bio-polymer interfaces sensitive to different colors and, in perspective, for the realization of a three-chromatic artificial visual prosthesis.",

            "abstract": "© 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. We traced the connections of the macaque Granular Frontal Opercular (GrFO) area, located in the rostralmost part of the frontal opercular margin, and compared them with those of the caudally adjacent dorsal opercular (DO) and precentral opercular (PrCO) areas. Area GrFO displays strong connections with areas DO, PrCO, and ventrolateral prefrontal (VLPF) area 12l, and even more with the mostly hand-related ventral premotor (PMv) area F5a. Other connections involve the mostly face/mouth-related PMv area F5c, the arm-related area F6/pre-SMA, the hand-related fields of VLPF areas 46v and 12r, and area SII, mostly the hand representation. Furthermore, area GrFO shows rich connectivity with several components of the limbic system including orbitofrontal areas 12o, 12m, and 11, the agranular and dysgranular insula, the agranular cingulate area 24, and the amygdala. Thalamic afferents originate primarily from the parvocellular and the magnocellular subdivisions of the mediodorsal nucleus and from midline and intralaminar nuclei. This connectivity pattern clearly distinguishes area GrFO from areas DO and PrCO, characterized by a connectivity mostly involving oral sensorimotor and gustatory areas/subcortical structures. The present data suggest, based on connectivity patterns, an involvement of area GrFO in the cortical circuits for controlling goal-directed hand and face/mouth actions. In this context, area GrFO could represent a gateway for the access of limbic inputs, for example about subjective values, emotional significance of stimuli or internal states, to the PMv areas involved in selecting appropriate goal-directed hand and mouth/face actions.",

New experimental results on bacterial growth inspire a novel top-down approach to study cell metabolism, combining mass balance and proteomic constraints to extend and complement Flux Balance Analysis. We introduce here Constrained Allocation Flux Balance Analysis, CAFBA, in which the biosynthetic costs associated to growth are accounted for in an effective way through a single additional genome-wide constraint. Its roots lie in the experimentally observed pattern of proteome allocation for metabolic functions, allowing to bridge regulation and metabolism in a transparent way under the principle of growth-rate maximization. We provide a simple method to solve CAFBA efficiently and propose an “ensemble averaging” procedure to account for unknown protein costs. Applying this approach to modeling E. coli metabolism, we find that, as the growth rate increases, CAFBA solutions cross over from respiratory, growth-yield maximizing states (preferred at slow growth) to fermentative states with carbon overflow (preferred at fast growth). In addition, CAFBA allows for quantitatively accurate predictions on the rate of acetate excretion and growth yield based on only 3 parameters determined by empirical growth laws.",

The diameter of MWCNTs grown by chemical vapor deposition technique was in the range of 30-80 nm. In the second part, structures mimicking macroscopic finned heat sinks are used for enhancing forced convective heat transfer on a silicon substrate. Convective heat transfer coefficient has been experimentally measured for silicon substrates with and without MWCNT-based fins on it. The configuration with MWCNTs based fins shows an enhancement in convective heat transfer of 40% and 20%, as maximum and average value, respectively, compared to the bare silicon. Experiments have been carried out in a wind tunnel with air as coolant in fully turbulent regime. These encouraging results and the possibility of growing structures directly on silicon can be regarded as a first step.",

While the study of convergence of set-valued iterative maps is highly complex in general, this paper focuses on Boolean maps, which are comprised of arbitrary combinations of unions, intersections, and complements of sets. For these important class of systems, we provide tools to study both global and local convergence.

For application scenarios in which dexterous manipulation by each robot is not necessary, we propose using a rigid tool attached to the vehicle through a passive spherical joint, equipped with a simple adhesive mechanism at the tool-tip that can stick to the grasped object. Having more than two robots, we use the extra degrees of freedom to find the optimal force allocation in term of minimum power and forces smoothness. The human operator commands a desired trajectory for the robot team through a haptic interface to a pose controller, and the output of the pose controller along with system constraints, e.g., VTOL limited forces and contact maintenance, defines the feasible set of forces. Then, an on-line optimization allocates forces by minimizing a cost function of forces and their variation. Finally, propeller thrusts are computed by a dedicated attitude and thrust controller in a decentralized fashion. Human/Hardware in the loop simulation study shows efficiency of the proposed scheme, and the importance of haptic feedback to achieve a better performance.",

Being the perovskite precursor mixture a complex equilibrium of species, it is very difficult to predict/control their interactions with different substrates, thus the final film properties and device performances. Here the wettability of CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) onto poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) hole transporting layer is improved by exploiting the cooperative effect of graphene oxide (GO) and glucose inclusion. The glucose, in addition, triggers the reduction of GO, enhancing the conductivity of the PEDOT:PSS+GO+glucose based nanocomposite. The relevance of this approach toward photovoltaic applications is demonstrated by fabricating a hysteresis-free MAPbI3 solar cells displaying a ≈37% improvement in power conversion efficiency if compared to a device grown onto pristine PEDOT:PSS. Most importantly, VOC reaches values over 1.05 V that are among the highest ever reported for PEDOT:PSS p-i-n device architecture, suggesting minimal recombination losses, high hole-selectivity, and reduced trap density at the PEDOT:PSS along with optimized MAPbI3 coverage.",

Trans-lesion synthesis polymerases, like DNA Polymerase-η (Pol-η), are essential for cell survival. Pol-η bypasses ultraviolet-induced DNA damages via a two-metal-ion mechanism that assures DNA strand elongation, with formation of the leaving group pyrophosphate (PPi). Recent structural and kinetics studies have shown that Pol-η function depends on the highly flexible and conserved Arg61 and, intriguingly, on a transient third ion resolved at the catalytic site, as lately observed in other nucleic acid-processing metalloenzymes. How these conserved structural features facilitate DNA replication, however, is still poorly understood. Through extended molecular dynamics and free energy simulations, we unravel a highly cooperative and dynamic mechanism for DNA elongation and repair, which is here described by an equilibrium ensemble of structures that connect the reactants to the products in Pol-η catalysis. We reveal that specific conformations of Arg61 help facilitate the recruitment of the incoming base and favor the proper formation of a pre-reactive complex in Pol-η for efficient DNA editing. Also, we show that a third transient metal ion, which acts concertedly with Arg61, serves as an exit shuttle for the leaving PPi. Finally, we discuss how this effective and cooperative mechanism for DNA repair may be shared by other DNA-repairing polymerases.",

The bulk properties as well as the surface features of these particular microparticles define their final performance. In particular, multifunctional microgels with complex architectures have been widely used in multiplex assays for their favourable capability to accommodate encoding systems and anchoring groups for probes to capture circulating targets by simply changing synthesis parameters. In this work a limited set of fluorescent encoded poly(ethyleneglycol) based microgels, of size ranging between 0.5 and 1.3μm, with a core-shell architecture were obtained by combining precipitation and seeded polymerizations. Here we demonstrate the possibility of tailoring and controlling the bulk and surface properties according to the synthesis by fluorescence imaging and pH titrations. Concerning the structural characterization, we adopted a method to calculate polymer fraction volumes from AFM images and combined these with equilibrium swelling theory (Peppas-Merrill equation) to determine the mesh size of the microgels. Surface composition was probed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy directly on freeze-dried microgels. In such a way we were able to describe the organizations of the different adlayers also in response to pH, highlighting the possibility of some overlap of the adlayers representing physical barriers at the boundaries of each shell.

            "abstract": "© 2016 IEEE.The application of correlation filters for the task of facial landmark detection has been studied by many vision works. Their success, however, is limited by the presence of large pose variations, expression and occlusion in face images. Moreover, existing correlation filters may suffer from poor discrimination to distinguish visually similar landmarks such as the right and left eyes. In this work, we present a new framework, referred to as Correlation Filter Cascade, to address the above limitations. The proposed framework consists of a set of correlation filters with different spatial supports (sizes) which are connected together in a cascade form. More specifically, the size of filters decreases from the lower to upper levels. Filters at lower levels implicitly code face shape information since they are trained using large patches stemmed from face images. This avoids ambiguous detections caused by landmarks with similar appearance. Detections in these levels, however, may not be accurate and suffer from small localization errors, mainly caused by face pose, expression and occlusion. Therefore, locations detected by lower levels will be further used by the higher levels to narrow down their search regions. Since the filters at higher levels have smaller size, they are less affected by pose, expression and occlusion, and thus, can perform more accurately. The evaluation on BioID and LFPW shows the superiority of our method compared to prior correlation filters and leading facial landmark detectors.",

Potentiodynamic tests were performed in aerated diluted Harrison solution, on specimens with different orientation with respect to the building plane. Different surface finishing were analyzed, covering rough surfaces as produced by DMLS and after polishing by means of emery papers and alumina slurry or chemical polishing with phosphoric and nitric acid bright dipping (BD). A conversion treatment by short immersion in Ce(III) salt solution was evaluated in order to improve corrosion resistance of both as-produced surface and polished surface. Selective attack of α-Al phase occurs at the border of the melting pools, typical of DMLS process, and slightly reduces on transversal planes, perpendicular to the building plane. Acid pickling slightly improves the corrosion resistance of as-produced surface, but no positive effects were noticed on polished one. The Ce(III) conversion treatment does not inhibit corrosion on as-produced specimens. Its effectiveness is higher on polished and pickled specimens. On polished surface, the effectiveness of conversion treatment mainly depends on plane orientation. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.",

            "abstract": "© The Author 2016. Corticostriatal projections from the primate cortical motor areas partially overlap in different zones of a large postcommissural putaminal sector designated as \"motor\" putamen. These zones are at the origin of parallel basal ganglia-thalamocortical subloops involved in modulating the cortical motor output. However, it is still largely unknown how parietal and prefrontal areas, connected to premotor areas, and involved in controlling higher order aspects of motor control, project to the basal ganglia. Based on tracer injections at the cortical level, we analyzed the corticostriatal projections of the macaque hand-related ventrolateral prefrontal, ventral premotor, and inferior parietal areas forming a network for controlling purposeful hand actions (lateral grasping network). The results provided evidence for partial overlap or interweaving of these projections in correspondence of 2 putaminal zones, distinct fromthe motor putamen, one located just rostral to the anteriorcommissure, the other in the caudal and ventral part. Thus, the present data provide evidence for partial overlap or interweaving in specific striatal zones (input channels) of projections from multiple, even remote, areas taking part in a large-scale functionally specialized cortical network. Furthermore, they suggest the presence of multiple hand-related input channels, possibly differentially involved in controlling goal-directed hand actions.",

We report a facile synthesis of cube-shaped CoxFe3-xO4 nanocrystals (NCs), which could be finely tuned in terms of NC size (from 15 to 27 nm) and cobalt stoichiometry (from 0.1 to 0.7). These particles exhibited high specific absorption rate (SAR) values, relevant for magnetic hyperthermia, and high relaxivity values, significant for magnetic resonance imaging applications. The peculiarity of these NCs is that already at low frequencies (such as 105 kHz, a working frequency used on human patients), they display SAR values that are three-times as large as those of iron oxide nanocubes of comparable sizes (and which were already considered outstanding). The highest SAR value recorded on the NCs reported here (915 ± 10 W/g(Co+Fe) at 105 kHz and 32 kAm-1) refers to particles with cubic shape, 20 ± 2 nm edge size, and Co stoichiometry between 0.6 and 0.7. The highest r2 value (958 mM-1 s-1) was instead recorded on nanocubes with Co stoichiometry around 0.5/0.6 and size of 20 ± 2 nm. Remarkably, only at this specific size and Co stoichiometry were the NCs not perfect cubes but had a slightly concave shape, which together with their core-shell structure and magnetic parameters might account for the higher r2 values recorded. NCs reported here, with optimized SAR and r2 values, are promising tools for theranostic applications.",

The antihydrogen formation by charge exchange between cold antiprotons and Rydberg positronium Ps∗ is studied by using the classical trajectory Monte Carlo method. In the absence of external magnetic field the cross section scaled by the fourth power of the Ps∗ principal quantum number nPs shows a universal behavior as a function of the ratio kv between the velocity of the Ps center of mass and that of the positron in the classical circular orbit. At low velocity, below about kv≃0.2-0.3, we show for Rydberg positronium that the cross section increases as 1/kv2 or, in an equivalent way, as 1/EPscm with EPscm being the Ps∗ center-of-mass energy. In this regime the distribution of the principal quantum number of the antihydrogen state is narrow and it shows a peak at about 2nPs while at higher kv values a broad distribution of antihydrogen states is produced. The study of the collision process in the presence of moderate magnetic field (0.5-2 T) shows that there is an experimentally interesting region of kv with the cross section slightly higher than that in the absence of field. However the presence of a magnetic field changes significantly the cross section behavior as a function of kv, especially at low velocities, where reductions of the cross sections and deviations from the 1/kv2 (1/EPscm) are observed. Our calculations show a dependance of the cross section upon the angle between the magnetic field and the flight direction of the incoming Ps∗.",

            "abstract": "© 2016, The Author(s).In crowd behavior studies, a model of crowd behavior needs to be trained using the information extracted from video sequences. Most of the previous methods are based on low-level visual features because there are only crowd behavior labels available as ground-truth information in crowd datasets. However, there is a huge semantic gap between low-level motion/appearance features and high-level concept of crowd behaviors. In this paper, we tackle the problem by introducing an attribute-based scheme. While similar strategies have been employed for action and object recognition, to the best of our knowledge, for the first time it is shown that the crowd emotions can be used as attributes for crowd behavior understanding. We explore the idea of training a set of emotion-based classifiers, which can subsequently be used to indicate the crowd motion. In this scheme, we collect a large dataset of video clips and provide them with both annotations of “crowd behaviors” and “crowd emotions”. We test the proposed emotion based crowd representation methods on our dataset. The obtained promising results demonstrate that the crowd emotions enable the construction of more descriptive models for crowd behaviors. We aim at publishing the dataset with the article, to be used as a benchmark for the communities.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Amadoriases, also known as fructosyl amine oxidases (FAOX), are enzymes that catalyze the de-glycosylation of fructosyl amino acids. As such, they are excellent candidates for the development of enzyme-based diagnostic and therapeutic tools against age- and diabetes-induced protein glycation. However, mostly because of the lack of a complete structural characterization of the different members of the family, the molecular bases of their substrate specificity have yet to be fully understood. The high resolution crystal structures of the free and the substrate-bound form of Amadoriase I shown herein allow for the identification of key structural features that account for the diverse substrate specificity shown by this class of enzymes. This is of particular importance in the context of the rather limited and partially incomplete structural information that has so far been available in the literature on the members of the FAOX family. Moreover, using molecular dynamics simulations, we describe the tunnel conformation and the free energy profile experienced by the ligand in going from bulk water to the catalytic cavity, showing the presence of four gating helices/loops, followed by an \"L-shaped\" narrow cavity. In summary, the tridimensional architecture of Amadoriase I presented herein provides a reference structural framework for the design of novel enzymes for diabetes monitoring and protein deglycation.",

Besides, postsynthetic treatments, such as thermally activated solid-state reactions, represent a further flourishing route to promote finely controlled cation exchange. Here, we report that, upon in situ heating in a transmission electron microscope, Cu2Se or Cu nanocrystals deposited on an amorphous solid substrate undergo partial loss of Cu atoms, which are then engaged in local cation exchange reactions with Cu ″acceptor″ phases represented by rod- A nd wire-shaped CdSe nanocrystals. This thermal treatment slowly transforms the initial CdSe nanocrystals into Cu2-xSe nanocrystals, through the complete sublimation of Cd and the partial sublimation of Se atoms. Both Cu ″donor″ and ″acceptor″ particles were not always in direct contact with each other; hence, the gradual transfer of Cu species from Cu2Se or metallic Cu to CdSe nanocrystals was mediated by the substrate and depended on the distance between the donor and acceptor nanostructures. Differently from what happens in the comparably faster cation exchange reactions performed in liquid solution, this study shows that slow cation exchange reactions can be performed at the solid state and helps to shed light on the intermediate steps involved in such reactions.",

We obtained an unprecedented pharmacokinetic profile of curcumin with the best formulation, represented by a combination of a small nanoemulsion size (110 nm), co-delivery of curcumin and piperine (weight ratio 100:1) and a high degree of chitosan thiolation (14-15%). Then, we assessed its anti-inflammatory properties after oral administration in rats at low doses (=0.1 times the volume administered in the pharmacokinetic study).

This paper presents an alternative approach that enables the surgeon to feel fingertip contact deformations and vibrations while guaranteeing the teleoperator's stability. We implemented our cutaneous feedback solution on an Intuitive Surgical da Vinci Standard robot by mounting a SynTouch BioTac tactile sensor to the distal end of a surgical instrument and a custom cutaneous display to the corresponding master controller. As the user probes the remote environment, the contact deformations, dc pressure, and ac pressure (vibrations) sensed by the BioTac are directly mapped to input commands for the cutaneous device's motors using a model-free algorithm based on look-up tables. The cutaneous display continually moves, tilts, and vibrates a flat plate at the operator's fingertip to optimally reproduce the tactile sensations experienced by the BioTac. We tested the proposed approach by having eighteen subjects use the augmented da Vinci robot to palpate a heart model with no haptic feedback, only deformation feedback, and deformation plus vibration feedback. Fingertip deformation feedback significantly improved palpation performance by reducing the task completion time, the pressure exerted on the heart model, and the subject's absolute error in detecting the orientation of the embedded plastic stick. Vibration feedback significantly improved palpation performance only for the seven subjects who dragged the BioTac across the model, rather than pressing straight into it.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 Authors. Hydrogen sulfide is an endogenous gasotransmitter and its mechanism of action involves activation of ATP-sensitive K+ channels and phosphodiesterase inhibition. As both mechanisms are potentially involved in malignant hyperthermia (MH), in the present study we addressed the involvement of the L-cysteine/hydrogen sulfide pathway in MH. Skeletal muscle biopsies obtained from 25 MH-susceptible (MHS) and 56 MH-negative (MHN) individuals have been used to perform the in vitro contracture test (IVCT). Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) and Western blotting studies have also been performed. Hydrogen sulfide levels are measured in both tissue samples and plasma. In MHS biopsies an increase in cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) occurs, as both mRNA and protein expression compared with MHN biopsies. Hydrogen sulfide biosynthesis is increased in MHS biopsies (0.128± 0.12 compared with 0.943± 0.13 nmol/mg of protein per min for MHN and MHS biopsies, respectively; P &lt; 0.01). Addition of sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS) to MHS samples evokes a response similar, in the IVCT, to that elicited by either caffeine or halothane. Incubation of MHN biopsies with NaHS, before caffeine or halothane challenge, switches an MHN to an MHS response. In conclusion we demonstrate the involvement of the L-cysteine/hydrogen sulfide pathway in MH, giving new insight into MH molecular mechanisms. This finding has potential implications for clinical care and could help to define less invasive diagnostic procedures.",

The excitation of plasmonic Fano resonances leads to a dual advantage in nano-photonics, in terms of local field enhancement and far-field spectral selectivity. Nevertheless, a remarkable challenge related to the hybridization between bright and dark plasmonic modes, i.e. between the two elements cooperating to the Fano resonance generation, consists in the sub-wavelength activation of dark modes via near-field channel. In this regard, strongly coupled plasmonic nano-assemblies are ideal systems providing a highly efficient way towards their excitation. Here, we analyze two trimer nano-architectures supporting respectively electric and magnetic Fano resonances. The different approaches employed for describing the two systems highlighted the role that the near-field coupling and the LSPs de-phasing separately play in the Fano hybridization phenomena.",

Ungrounded cutaneous feedback provides an elegant and inherently stable way to refer haptic feedback to the surgeon in such situations. Choosing the most appropriate display, however, is challenging given the substantial number of unique cutaneous displays presented in the literature. In this work, we demonstrate how measuring the space of tactile sensations that a device can create can be employed to objectively compare different cutaneous displays for a specific task. We built four cutaneous displays and compared their ability to render sensations measured while pinching four disparate materials with a biomimetic tactile sensor. As predicted, quantitative tactile rendering errors varied significantly across devices and materials. The results of this comparison can be used to design better cutaneous displays for pinching palpation in robotic surgery. Furthermore, the proposed approach could provide a useful tool for evaluating novel cutaneous devices for various other tactile tasks, providing an objective framework to supplement and guide future human subject studies.",

In this paper, we present a methodology to reconcile these two distinct and apparently incompatible approaches under a unified framework: this allows us to obtain a data-generated grasp taxonomy along with low-dimensional representations which could be used for human grasping data classification and posture reconstruction, as well as for simplifying grasp planning algorithms and robotic hands programming.",

To refine these clusters further, the outliers from queryimage's belonging cluster are excluded by Support Vector Clus-tering (SVC). Then One-Class SupportVector Machine (OCSVM) is used for the prediction of relevant images from query image's belongingcluster and the initial retrieval results based on the similarity measurement is feed to OCSVM for training. Images are ranked from the positively labeled images. This method gives more than 95% precisionbefore recall reaches at 0.5 for conceptually meaningful query categories.

There has been a longstanding controversy over whether it is possible to understand others' intentions by simply observing their movements. Here, we show that indeed movement kinematics can form the basis for intention detection. By combining kinematics and psychophysical methods with classification and regression tree (CART) modeling, we found that observers utilized a subset of discriminant kinematic features over the total kinematic pattern in order to detect intention from observation of simple motor acts. Intention discriminability covaried with movement kinematics on a trial-by-trial basis, and was directly related to the expression of discriminative features in the observed movements. These findings demonstrate a definable and measurable relationship between the specific features of observed movements and the ability to discriminate intention, providing quantitative evidence of the significance of movement kinematics for anticipating others' intentional actions.",

Our analysis revealed heterogeneous miRNA half-lives, with many species behaving as stable molecules (T1/2 &gt; 24 h), while others, including passenger miRNAs and a number (25/129) of guide miRNAs, are quickly turned over (T1/2 = 4-14 h). Decay rates were coupled with other features, including genomic organization, transcription rates, structural heterogeneity (isomiRs), and target abundance, measured through quantitative experimental approaches. This comprehensive analysis highlighted functional mechanisms that mediate miRNA degradation, as well as the importance of decay dynamics in the regulation of the miRNA pool under both steady-state conditions and during cell transitions.",

Fitting TA spectra in time, as Gaussian functions and their derivative-like shifted Gaussians, allows to individually extract the real dynamics of both photobleached transitions, and their energy shifts. In CdTe nanorods (NRs) we found a delayed heating of holes due to the release of the large excess energy in the electron relaxation process. The slow hole-trapping process is consistent with a high number of surface trap states in these model NRs.

            "abstract": "Study Objectives: Sleep-wake disturbances are often reported in Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), a rare neurodevelopmental syndrome that is associated with paternally-expressed genomic imprinting defects within the human chromosome region 15q11-13. One of the candidate genes, prevalently expressed in the brain, is the small nucleolar ribonucleic acid-116 (S NO RD116). Here we conducted a translational study into the sleep abnormalities of PWS, testing the hypothesis that S N O R D116 is responsible for sleep defects that characterize the syndrome. Methods: We studied sleep in mutant mice that carry a deletion of Snord 116 at the orthologous locus (mouse chromosome 7) of the human PWS critical region (PWScr). In particular, we assessed EEG and temperature profiles, across 24-h, in PWScrm+/p- heterozygous mutants compared to wild-type littermates. High-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed to explore morphoanatomical differences according to the genotype. Moreover, we complemented the mouse work by presenting two patients with a diagnosis of PWS and characterized by atypical small deletions of SNORD 116. We compared the individual EEG parameters of patients with healthy subjects and with a cohort of obese subjects. Results: By studying the mouse mutant line PWScrm+/p-, we observed specific rapid eye movement (REM) sleep alterations including abnormal electroencephalograph (EEG) theta waves. Remarkably, we observed identical sleep/EEG defects in the two PWS cases. We report brain morphological abnormalities that are associated with the EEG alterations. In particular, mouse mutants have a bilateral reduction of the gray matter volume in the ventral hippocampus and in the septum areas, which are pivotal structures for maintaining theta rhythms throughout the brain. In PWScrm+/p- mice we also observed increased body temperature that is coherent with REM sleep alterations in mice and human patients. Conclusions: Our study indicates that paternally expressed Snord 116 is involved in the 24-h regulation of sleep physiological measures, suggesting that it is a candidate gene for the sleep disturbances that most individuals with PWS experience.",

This work aims at enhancing intra-operative surgical visualization by exploiting the 3D information about the surgical site. An interactive guidance system is proposed wherein the pose of preoperative tissue models is updated online. A critical process involves the intra-operative acquisition of tissue surfaces. It can be achieved using stereoscopic imaging and 3D reconstruction techniques. This work contributes to this process by proposing new methods for improved dense 3D reconstruction of soft tissues, which allows a more accurate deformation identification and facilitates the registration process. Methods: Two methods for soft tissue 3D reconstruction are proposed: Method 1 follows the traditional approach of the block matching algorithm. Method 2 performs a nonparametric modified census transform to be more robust to illumination variation. The simple linear iterative clustering (SLIC) super-pixel algorithm is exploited for disparity refinement by filling holes in the disparity images. Results: The methods were validated using two video datasets from the Hamlyn Centre, achieving an accuracy of 2.95 and 1.66 mm, respectively. A comparison with ground-truth data demonstrated the disparity refinement procedure: (1) increases the number of reconstructed points by up to 43 % and (2) does not affect the accuracy of the 3D reconstructions significantly. Conclusion: Both methods give results that compare favorably with the state-of-the-art methods. The computational time constraints their applicability in real time, but can be greatly improved by using a GPU implementation.",

This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited. Some blind people have developed a unique technique, called echolocation, to orient themselves in unknown environments. More specifically, by self-generating a clicking noise with the tongue, echolocators gain knowledge about the external environment by perceiving more detailed object features. It is not clear to date whether sighted individuals can also develop such an extremely useful technique. To investigate this, here we test the ability of novice sighted participants to perform a depth echolocation task. Moreover, in order to evaluate whether the type of room (anechoic or reverberant) and the type of clicking sound (with the tongue or with the hands) influences the learning of this technique, we divided the entire sample into four groups. Half of the participants produced the clicking sound with their tongue, the other half with their hands. Half of the participants performed the task in an anechoic chamber, the other half in a reverberant room. Subjects stood in front of five bars, each of a different size, and at five different distances from the subject. The dimension of the bars ensured a constant subtended angle for the five distances considered. The task was to identify the correct distance of the bar. We found that, even by the second session, the participants were able to judge the correct depth of the bar at a rate greater than chance. Improvements in both precision and accuracy were observed in all experimental sessions. More interestingly, we found significantly better performance in the reverberant room than in the anechoic chamber. The type of clicking did not modulate our results. This suggests that the echolocation technique can also be learned by sighted individuals and that room reverberation can influence this learning process. More generally, this study shows that total loss of sight is not a prerequisite for echolocation skills this suggests important potential implications on rehabilitation settings for persons with residual vision.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 IEEE. Transoral Laser Microsurgeries (TLM) are complex otolaryngological procedures requiring the surgeons to perform intraoperative tissue manipulation with great level of control, accuracy and precision. The process involves the use of a surgical laser to treat abnormalities in the throat without any external incisions. The best removal of the malignant tissue is possible only with coordinated control of the laser aiming for incision and the microsurgical tools for orienting and stretching the tissue. However, the traditional microsurgical tools are long, single purpose, one degree-of-freedom (DOF), rigid tools with small range of motion and a traditional grasping handle inducing non-ergonomic usage. Additionally, there are different variety of microsurgical tools with different modes of actuation for the forceps jaws, i.e., in one mode push action of inner translating rod closes the forceps jaws and in other mode the same action opens the jaws. This paper presents a novel, modular microsurgical tool design to overcome the challenges of the traditional tools and improve the surgeon-tool usage experience. The novel design adds a rotational DOF to expand the reach and functionality of the tool. The device is provided with a grasping handle that avoids extreme wrist excursions. A straight line motion mechanism is synthesized such that it is capable of adapting to the variety of tools used in TLM within the same device design. This mechanism was validated by ADAMS simulation as well. The proposed new design adds benefits of functional usage for the surgeons, potentially simplifying the surgical tasks.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 IEEE. Exoskeletons targeting the upper limb have been broadly developed both for rehabilitation and to augment user's physical performance. Generally, they are rigid robotic interfaces characterized by a non negligible mechanical impedance at the end effector and consequently perceived by the upper limbs as an external body. The rigid frame, moreover, adds kinematic constrains to the natural joint kinematics which may result in discomfort and ultimately in pain. The concept of soft wearable exoskeleton (or exosuit) has been developed and tested for the lower limb and the hand to address such issues thanks to their minimal inertial contribution and influence on the natural kinematics. In the current paper the design of an soft robotic interface for the elbow joint is presented, whose aim is to provide assistance torque to the targeted joint to facilitate the execution of the activities of daily living. Differently from the state-of-The-Art design solutions, our system is able to drive both flexion and extension of the same joint with a single motor in an agonist-Antagonist fashion, making the actuation stage compact and energy efficient. A clutching mechanism is also included in the design in order to save power during static configuration, preventing the motor to hold the joint position for a large amount of time. An exosuit has been designed to transfer the torque of the actuator to the biomechanical joint by means of Bowden cables. Two series elastic elements are employed to overcome the drawbacks of the agonist-Antagonist mechanism and to provide additional compliance at the end effector. A preliminary test has been finally performed in order to characterize the actuation.",

The actuator is conceived to be installed on both the knee and the ankle joint of the version three of the humanoid robot iCub. The actuator is composed of an electric motor, a gearbox, and a customized torsion spring. The stiffness value of the torsion spring is the outcome of an optimisation problem that considers several criteria, e.g., the maximum readable torque from the SEA and the total stiffness of the mechanism. Then, the synthesis of the elastic element exploits a Finite Element Method (FEM), which allows us to meet the requirements. Experiments on the conceived design have been performed on a custom set-up, and they verify the match between the desired and real value of the mechanism stiffness with a maximum resultant error of 9%.

The probe design limits the fluid drag and allows settling times of 200 μ s or less depending on the compliance of the probe. Moreover, the custom-tailored tip geometry of this device allows good coupling to a variety of sensory structures. The probe can be used as a force sensor or a force actuator using force-displacement calibration curves computed by the finite-element method (FEM).

It consists of a lightweight bracelet with four servo motors. Each motor actuates a cylindrical shaped end-effector that is able to rotate, generating skin stretch stimuli. To understand how to control and wear the device on the forearm to evoke the most effective cutaneous sensations, we carried out perceptual experiments evaluating its absolute and differential thresholds. Finally, we carried out an experiment of haptic navigation to assess the effectiveness of our device as a navigation feedback system to guide a desired rotation and translation of the forearm. Results demonstrate an average rotation and translation error of 1.87° and 2.84 mm, respectively. Moreover, all the subjects found our device easy to wear and comfortable. Nine out of ten found it effective in transmitting navigation information to the forearm.",

The letter studies and presents a novel method to select the design parameters of asymmetric compliant actuation schemes to improve the energy efficiency of multi-DoF articulated robots powered by this type of actuators. An optimisation problem is formulated to optimise the actuation parameters for energy efficient operation. Simulation studies performed on a 2-DoF leg as proof-of-concept demonstrate significant improvements in electrical energy efficiency and reduction in peak torque and electrical power requirements. Furthermore, biarticulated actuation arrangements are also investigated, and they are proven to further enhance the energy efficiency of the robotic leg.",

To gain insight into the role of isolated fragments of NPM1 in its biological activities, we dissected the C-terminal domain (CTD) into its helical fragments. Here we focus the attention on the third helix of the NPM1-CTD in its wild-type (H3 wt) and AML-mutated (H3 mutA and H3 mutE) sequences. Conformational studies, by means of CD and NMR spectroscopies, showed that the H3 wt peptide was partially endowed with an a-helical structure, but the AML-sequences exhibited a lower content of this conformation, particularly the H3 mutA peptide. Thioflavin T assays showed that the H3 mutE and the H3 mutA peptides displayed a significant aggregation propensity that was confirmed by CD and DLS assays. In addition, we found that the H3 mutE and H3 mutA peptides, unlike the H3 wt, were moderately and highly toxic, respectively, when exposed to human neuroblastoma cells. Cellular localization experiments confirmed that the mutated sequences hamper their nucleolar accumulation, and more importantly, that the helical conformation of the H3 region is crucial for such a localization.",

Unlike standard approaches that employ low level motion features, e.g. optical flow, to form video descriptors, we propose to exploit mid-level features extracted from long-range motion trajectories called tracklets, which have been successfully applied for action modeling and video analysis. Following standard procedure, a video sequence is divided into spatio-temporal cuboids within whichwe collect statistics of the tracklets passing through them. Specifically, tracklets orientation and magnitude are quantized in a two-dimensional histogram which encodes the actual motion patterns in each cuboid. These histograms are then fed into machine learning models (e.g., Latent Dirichlet allocation and Support Vector Machines) to detect abnormal behaviors in video sequences. The evaluation of the proposed descriptor on different datasets, namely UCSD, BEHAVE, UMN and Violence in Crowds, yields compelling results in abnormality detection, by setting new state-of-the-art and outperforming former descriptors based on the optical flow, dense trajectories and social force models.",

            "abstract": "© 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.Detecting groups is becoming of relevant interest as an important step for scene (and especially activity) understanding. Differently from what is commonly assumed in the computer vision community, different types of groups do exist, and among these, standing conversational groups (a.k.a. F-formations) play an important role. An F-formation is a common type of people aggregation occurring when two or more persons sustain a social interaction, such as a chat at a cocktail party. Indeed, detecting and subsequently classifying such an interaction in images or videos is of considerable importance in many applicative contexts, like surveillance, social signal processing, social robotics or activity classification, to name a few. This paper presents a principled method to approach to this problem grounded upon the socio-psychological concept of an F-formation. More specifically, a game-theoretic framework is proposed, aimed at modeling the spatial structure characterizing F-formations. In other words, since F-formations are subject to geometrical configurations on how humans have to be mutually located and oriented, the proposed solution is able to account for these constraints while also statistically modeling the uncertainty associated with the position and orientation of the engaged persons. Moreover, taking advantage of video data, it is also able to integrate temporal information over multiple frames utilizing the recent notions from multi-payoff evolutionary game theory. The experiments have been performed on several benchmark datasets, consistently showing the superiority of the proposed approach over the state of the art, and its robustness under severe noise conditions.",

Identifying emergent leader is an important issue for organizations. It is also a well- investigated topic in social psychology while a relatively new problem in social signal processing (SSP). The effectiveness of nonverbal features have been shown by many previous SSP studies. In general, the nonverbal video-based features were not more effective compared to audio-based features although, their fusion generally improved the overall performance. However, in absence of audio sensors, the accurate detection of social interactions is still crucial. Motivating from that, we propose novel, automatically extracted, non- verbal features to identify the emergent leadership. The extracted nonverbal features were based on automatically estimated visual focus of attention which is based on head pose. The evaluation of the proposed method and the defined features were realized using a new dataset which is firstly introduced in this paper including its design, collection and annotation. The effectiveness of the features and the method were also compared with many state of the art features and methods.",

The Bi-L3 edge EXAFS reveals wide Bi-Te distance distribution for both compounds indicating complex atomic arrangements in the studied system. The mean square relative displacements (MSRDs) of the Bi-Te bond distances appear largely increased in Pb substituted system due to larger overall local disorder, however, one of the Bi-Te bonds shows a reduced disorder. On the other hand, the Bi-L3 edge XANES is hardly affected by Pb substitution while the Te-L1 edge XANES reveals increased density of unoccupied Te 5p states. This suggests that the carriers introduced by the Pb substitution in CsBi4-xPbxTe6 preferentially goes on Te sites. Similarly, the Cs-L3 edge XANES also shows small changes due to Pb-substitution and reduced local disorder indicated by the reduced width of the Cs-L3 edge white line. We have also shown that the X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) measurements on various electronic core levels are in a qualitative agreement with the XANES results. These findings are consistent with carrier doping and a reduced disorder in one direction to be likely factors to drive the thermoelectric CsBi4Te6 into a bulk superconductor by Pb-substitution in CsBi4-xPbxTe6.",

            "abstract": "© 1996-2012 IEEE.This paper presents the development and control of a novel asymmetric antagonistic actuation scheme characterized by large energy storage capacity that enables efficient execution of motions. The asymmetric design consists of two actuation branches that transfer their power to a single joint through two compliant elements with different stiffness and storage capacity properties. The guideline for selecting the stiffness of both elements is elaborated, given the design parameters and control requirements. We propose a novel control strategy that distributes the effort required to generate the motion using the two actuation branches of this novel hardware, to drive the prototype joint in an energy efficient manner. As a proof of concept, a single degree-of-freedom knee-actuated hopping robot is designed for experimental validation. The dynamics of the leg and actuators are rigorously modeled and formulated. The data from simulation and experimental studies demonstrate a significant improvement in electrical energy efficiency and reduction in torque requirements.",

We report the discovery of compound 4a, a potent β-lactam-based monoacylglycerol lipase (MGL) inhibitor characterized by an irreversible and stereoselective mechanism of action, high membrane permeability, high brain penetration evaluated using a human in vitro blood-brain barrier model, high selectivity in binding and affinity-based proteomic profiling assays, and low in vitro toxicity. Mode-of-action studies demonstrate that 4a, by blocking MGL, increases 2-arachidonoylglycerol and behaves as a cannabinoid (CB1/CB2) receptor indirect agonist. Administration of 4a in mice suffering from experimental autoimmune encephalitis ameliorates the severity of the clinical symptoms in a CB1/CB2-dependent manner. Moreover, 4a produced analgesic effects in a rodent model of acute inflammatory pain, which was antagonized by CB1 and CB2 receptor antagonists/inverse agonists. 4a also relieves the neuropathic hypersensitivity induced by oxaliplatin. Given these evidence, 4a, as MGL selective inhibitor, could represent a valuable lead for the future development of therapeutic options for multiple sclerosis and chronic pain.",

Background: Ventriculostomy is a widely performed neurosurgical procedure; some risk factors can be mitigated by computer/robot-assisted approaches. Platforms fostering synergistic robot-surgeon integration are pursued, for which lightweight robots with compliant controlled joints must be assessed (because compliance hampers accuracy). Methods: We developed a platform encompassing, in particular, a lightweight robot and an optical tracker also used to enhance robot accuracy. Based on specifications by neurosurgeons, we designed a neuroendoscope-handling interface and assessed targeting accuracy in a model ventriculostomy where the robot was operated both autonomously and in hands-on (i.e. co-operative) mode. Results: Targeting errors were systematically below the procedure accuracy threshold (1 mm); the rms targeting errors were 0.51 and 0.54 mm for autonomous and hands-on control, respectively. No significant difference was observed between the considered control modes. Very positive feedback was gathered from neurosurgeons. Conclusions: Accurate tool targeting under both autonomous and hands-on control was achieved.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 IEEE.The tutor-tutee hand-in-hand teaching may be the most effective approach for a tutee to acquire new motor skills. Repetitive nature of such procedures in a group setting usually results in a high labour cost and time inefficiency. Potential solution can be utilizing robotic platforms playing the role of tutors for demonstrating and transferring the required skills. This requires an appropriate guidance scheme to integrate the tutor's motor functionalities into the robot's control architecture. For instance, for hand-in-hand supervision of the writing task, the tutor's corrections can be applied when necessary, while a very compliant motion can be achieved if no errors are detected. Inspired by this behavior, we develop a teaching interface using a dual-arm robotic platform. In our setup, one arm is connected to the tutees arm providing guidance through a variable stiffness control approach, and the other to the tutor to capture the motion and to feedback the tutees performance in a haptic manner. The reference stiffness for the tutors arm stiffness is estimated in real-time and replicated by the tutees robotic arm. Comparative experiments have been carried out on a dual-arm Baxter robot. The results imply that the human tutor is able to intuitively transfer writing skills to the tutee and also show superior learning performance over over some conventional teaching by demonstration techniques.",

The goal of this review is to create a link between neuroscientists and engineers by opening a discussion about the direction that the development of technological devices for visually impaired people is taking. Firstly, we review works on spatial and social skills in children with visual impairments, showing that lack of vision is associated with other sensory and motor delays. Secondly, we present some of the technological solutions developed to date for visually impaired people. Doing this, we highlight the core features of these systems and discuss their limits. We also discuss the possible reasons behind the low adaptability in children.",

The electrons of the NV center, largely localized at the vacancy site, combine to form a spin triplet, which can be polarized with 532 nm laser light, even at room temperature. The NV's states are isolated from environmental perturbations making their spin coherence comparable to trapped ions. An important breakthrough would be in connecting, using waveguides, multiple diamond NVs together optically. However, still lacking is an efficient photonic fabrication method for diamond akin to the photolithographic methods that have revolutionized silicon photonics. Here, we report the first demonstration of three dimensional buried optical waveguides in diamond, inscribed by focused femtosecond high repetition rate laser pulses. Within the waveguides, high quality NV properties are observed, making them promising for integrated magnetometer or quantum information systems on a diamond chip.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 Bentham Science Publishers. The diaryl urea is an important fragment/pharmacophore in constructing anticancer molecules due to its near-perfect binding with certain acceptors. The urea NH moiety is a favorable hydrogen bond donor, while the urea oxygen atom is regarded as an excellent acceptor. Many novel compounds have been synthesized and evaluated for their antitumor activity with the successful development of sorafenib. Moreover, this structure is used to link alkylating pharmacophores with high affinity DNA binders. In addition, the diaryl urea is present in several kinase inhibitors, such as RAF, KDR and Aurora kinases. Above all, this moiety is used in the type II inhibitors: it usually forms one or two hydrogen bonds with a conserved glutamic acid and one with the backbone amide of the aspartic acid in the DFG motif. In addition, some diaryl urea derivatives act as Hedgehog (Hh) ligands, binding and inhibiting proteins involved in the homonymous Hh signaling pathway. In this review we provide some of the methodologies adopted for the synthesis of diaryl ureas and a description of the most representative antitumor agents bearing the diaryl urea moiety, focusing on their mechanisms bound to the receptors and structure-activity relationships (SAR). An increased knowledge of these derivatives could prompt the search to find new and more potent compounds.",

            "abstract": "© 2016. Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a severe and fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive loss of motoneurons, muscle atrophy and paralysis. Recent evidence suggests that ALS should be considered as a multi-systemic disease, in which several cell types contribute to motoneuron degeneration. In this view, mutations in ALS linked genes in other neural and non-neural cell types may exert non-cell autonomous effects on motoneuron survival and function. Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs) have been recently derived from several patients with ALS mutations and it has been shown that they can generate motoneurons in vitro, providing a valuable tool to study ALS. However, the potential of iPSCs could be further valorized by generating other cell types that may be relevant to the pathology. In this paper, by taking advantage of a novel inducible system for MyoD expression, we show that both control iPSCs and iPSCs carrying mutations in ALS genes can generate skeletal muscle cells. We provide evidence that both control and mutant iPSC-derived myotubes are functionally active. This in vitro system will be instrumental to dissect the molecular and cellular pathways impairing the complex motoneuron microenvironment in ALS.",

Since the discovery of the mechanism of action of typical antipsychotics in 1975, the dopamine theory of schizophrenia remains one of the principal doctrines to explain the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. According to this theory, increased dopaminergic neurotransmission involving D2 receptors results in dysregulation of intracellular signaling mechanisms, leading to manifestations of schizophrenia. D2 receptors signal through G protein-dependent and G protein-independent pathways, the latter involving Akt/GSK3 has proved to play a major role to the schizopheric phenotypes. GSK3 is known to play central roles in the regulation of metabolism, synaptic plasticity, and neurodevelopment. Moreover, several prominent risk factors and contributors of the disease converge on these downstream effectors of D2 receptor signaling. Finally, the medications used clinically for the management of schizophrenia affect this signaling pathway. Here, we review the signaling systems altered in schizophrenia with a focus on GSK3 networks and discuss their involvement in the pathophysiology of the disease as well as their potential for the development of diagnostic and therapeutic tools.",

            "abstract": "Â© 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.Recovering the 3D shape of an object from shading is a challenging problem due to the complexity of modeling light propagation and surface reflections. Photometric Stereo (PS) is broadly considered a suitable approach for high-resolution shape recovery, but its functionality is restricted to a limited set of object surfaces and controlled lighting setup. In particular, PS models generally consider reflection from objects as purely diffuse, with specularities being regarded as a nuisance that breaks down shape reconstruction. This is a serious drawback for implementing PS approaches, since most common materials have prominent specular components. In this paper, we propose a PS model that solves the problem for both diffuse and specular components aimed at shape recovery of generic objects with the approach being independent of the albedo values thanks to the image ratio formulation used. Notably, we show that by including specularities, it is possible to solve the PS problem for a minimal number of three images using a setup with three calibrated lights and a standard industrial camera. Even if an initial separation of diffuse and specular components is still required for each input image, experimental results on synthetic and real objects demonstrate the feasibility of our approach for shape reconstruction of complex geometries.",

The initial competitive reduction of water to H2 and ZnO to metallic Zn is responsible for the dynamic behaviour of both photocurrent and Faradaic efficiency of the device, which reaches 100 % Faradaic efficiency after 90 min operation. In any case, outstanding stable H2 flow of approximately 2 μmol h−1 is measured over 1 h at 0 V versus RHE and at neutral pH, after equilibrium between the Zn2+/Zn0 concentration in the AZO film is reached. This achievement opens new avenues for the development of allsolution-processed organic photoelectrochemical cells for the solar generation of H2 from sea water.",

In this paper, we consider a setting where a group of robots, equipped with standard cameras, must fully cover a surrounding area while minimizing associated movement costs. To address this problem, we use a descriptor for visual coverage that encodes a measure of the visual information contained in an area, based on a regular discretization of the environment in voxels. In particular, our measure of coverage is related to how much of each voxel volume is \"penetrated\" by the bundle of rays projected from the camera center. Crucially, our descriptor explicitly encodes the viewing direction from which the voxel is observed, which is a key element to measure coverage of visual sensors. Next, we propose an autonomous cooperative exploration approach to control robot movements. Specifically, based on our visual coverage descriptor, we define a utility function to encode the value of future moves for the robots, and we select the next move for a robot by performing a greedy maximization of such utility function. Finally, we empirically evaluate our approach in a simulation scenario based on real visual data and on widely used robotic tools (such as ROS and Stage). Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms baseline random approaches (i.e., random, semirandom, and uncoordinated) and thus is a valid solution for visual coverage in large-scale outdoor scenarios.",

Gravity - immutable on Earth - has been shown to be a key input to these mechanisms. Seminal fMRI studies performed during visual perception of falling objects and self-motion demonstrated that humans represent the action of gravity in parts of the cortical vestibular system; in particular, the insular cortex and the cerebellum. However, little is known as to whether a specific neural network is engaged when processing non-visual signals relevant to gravity. We asked participants to perform vertical and horizontal hand movements without visual control, while lying in a 3T-MRI scanner. We highlighted brain regions activated in the processing of vertical movements, for which the effects of gravity changed during execution. Precisely, the left insula was activated in vertical movements and not in horizontal movements. Moreover, the network identified by contrasting vertical and horizontal movements overlapped with neural correlates previously associated to the processing of simulated self-motion and visual perception of the vertical direction. Interestingly, we found that the insular cortex activity is direction-dependent which suggests that this brain region processes the effects of gravity on the moving limbs through non-visual signals.",

We have directly observed charge density modulation in the optimally doped Bi2201 at momentum transfer Q≃0.23 reciprocal lattice units, with smaller intensity and correlation length with respect to the underdoped sample. This demonstrates the short-range charge order in Bi2201 persists up to optimal doping, as in other hole-doped cuprates. We explored the nodal (diagonal) direction and found no charge order peak, confirming that charge density modulates only along the Cu-O bond directions. We measured the out-of-plane dependence of charge order, finding a flat response and no maxima at half integer L values. This suggests there is no out-of-plane phase correlation in single layer Bi2201, at variance from YBa2Cu3O6+x and La2-x(Ba,Sr)xCuO4. Combining our results with data from the literature we assess that charge order in Bi2201 exists in a large doping range across the phase diagram, i.e., 0.07p0.16, demonstrating thereby that it is intimately entangled with the antiferromagnetic background, the pseudogap, and superconductivity.",

Determining the initial pathway for ultrafast energy redistribution within biomolecules is a challenge, and haem proteins, for which energy can be deposited locally in the haem moiety using short light pulses, are suitable model systems to address this issue. However, data acquired using existing experimental techniques that fail to combine sufficient structural sensitivity with adequate time resolution have resulted in alternative hypotheses concerning the interplay between energy flow among highly excited vibrational levels and potential concomitant electronic processes. By developing a femtosecond-stimulated Raman set-up, endowed with the necessary tunability to take advantage of different resonance conditions, here we visualize the temporal evolution of energy redistribution over different vibrational modes in myoglobin. We establish that the vibrational energy initially stored in the highly excited Franck-Condon manifold is transferred with different timescales into low-and high-frequency modes, prior to slow dissipation through the protein. These findings demonstrate that a newly proposed mechanism involving the population dynamics of specific vibrational modes settles the controversy on the existence of transient electronic intermediates.",

Printed polymer electronics has held for long the promise of revolutionizing technology by delivering distributed, flexible, lightweight and cost-effective applications for wearables, healthcare, diagnostic, automation and portable devices. While impressive progresses have been registered in terms of organic semiconductors mobility, field-effect transistors (FETs), the basic building block of any circuit, are still showing limited speed of operation, thus limiting their real applicability. So far, attempts with organic FETs to achieve the tens of MHz regime, a threshold for many applications comprising the driving of high resolution displays, have relied on the adoption of sophisticated lithographic techniques and/or complex architectures, undermining the whole concept. In this work we demonstrate polymer FETs which can operate up to 20 MHz and are fabricated by means only of scalable printing techniques and direct-writing methods with a completely mask-less procedure. This is achieved by combining a fs-laser process for the sintering of high resolution metal electrodes, thus easily achieving micron-scale channels with reduced parasitism down to 0.19 pF mm-1, and a large area coating technique of a high mobility polymer semiconductor, according to a simple and scalable process flow.",

We calculated the absorption coefficient of colloidal wurtzite CdSe/CdS nanocrystals (NCs), ranging from spherical to strongly elongated shapes (aspect ratio up to 21) by correlating the NC absorbance spectrum to the NC elemental composition and overall dimensions. We compared experimental data with numerical finite-element calculations of the NC absorption coefficient, which can account for the nonspheroidal NC shape and the influence of the organic ligand shell. The results unveiled that quantum confinement effects influence the NC absorption properties, even at relatively high photon energies (∼4.2 eV). From a practical point of view, we provide a general expression for the absorption coefficient that only requires the knowledge of the NC aspect ratio and CdSe/CdS volume ratio, giving access to a fast and nondestructive estimate of NC concentrations in solution and single-particle absorption cross sections, relevant for a wide range of photonic applications. More fundamentally, the unique aspect ratio-dependence of the absorption coefficient allowed us to derive the real (εr) and imaginary (εi) parts of the dielectric constant, demonstrating that even at energies far above the band gap the NC absorption coefficient differs from bulk due to a reduction of both εr and εi. As the methods presented are general, our analysis can be applied to a wide range of materials of varying composition and yields comprehensive insight into the optical constants of colloidal nanocrystals.

            "abstract": "© 2016 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.Because Broca’s area is known to be involved in many cognitive functions, including language, music, and action processing, several attempts have been made to propose a unifying theory of its role that emphasizes a possible contribution to syntactic processing. Recently, we have postulated that Broca’s area might be involved in higher-order chunk processing during implicit learning of a motor sequence. Chunking is an information-processing mechanism that consists of grouping consecutive items in a sequence and is likely to be involved in all of the aforementioned cognitive processes. Demonstrating a contribution of Broca’s area to chunking during the learning of a nonmotor sequence that does not involve language could shed new light on its function. To address this issue, we used offline MRI-guided TMS in healthy volunteers to disrupt the activity of either the posterior part of Broca’s area (left Brodmann’s area [BA] 44) or a control site just before participants learned a perceptual sequence structured in distinct hierarchical levels. We found that disruption of the left BA 44 increased the processing time of stimuli representing the boundaries of higher-order chunks and modified the chunking strategy. The current results highlight the possible role of the left BA 44 in building up effector-independent representations of higher-order events in structured sequences. Thismight clarify the contribution of Broca’s area in processing hierarchical structures, a key mechanism in many cognitive functions, such as language and composite actions.",

In this paper, we present a method to scale up MTL methods which penalize the variance of the task weight vectors. The method builds upon the alternating direction method of multipliers to decouple the variance regularizer. It can be efficiently implemented by a distributed algorithm, in which the tasks are first independently solved and subsequently corrected to pool information from other tasks. We show that the method works well in practice and convergences in few distributed iterations. Furthermore, we empirically observe that the number of iterations is nearly independent of the number of tasks, yielding a computational gain of O(T) over standard solvers. We also present experiments on a large URL classification dataset, which is challenging both in terms of volume of data points and dimensionality. Our results confirm that MTL can obtain superior performance over either learning a common model or independent task learning.",

Individuals show significant variations in performing a motor act. Previous studies in the action observation literature have largely ignored this ubiquitous, if often unwanted, characteristic of motor performance, assuming movement patterns to be highly similar across repetitions and individuals. In the present study, we examined the possibility that individual variations in motor style directly influence the ability to understand and predict others' actions. To this end, we first recorded grasping movements performed with different intents and used a two-step cluster analysis to identify quantitatively 'clusters' of movements performed with similar movement styles (Experiment 1). Next, using videos of the same movements, we proceeded to examine the influence of these styles on the ability to judge intention from action observation (Experiments 2 and 3). We found that motor styles directly influenced observers' ability to 'read' others' intention, with some styles always being less 'readable' than others. These results provide experimental support for the significance of motor variability for action prediction, suggesting that the ability to predict what another person is likely to do next directly depends on her individual movement style.",

We propose a novel coclustering-based domain-adaptation algorithm for simultaneously generating classification maps for a set of remote sensing (RS) multitemporal images in this letter. Unsupervised domain-adaptation techniques consider two different but related domains: a source domain with ample number of labeled samples and a target domain with no labeled data. The task at hand is to build an inference model exploring the available data that is expected to work consistently well in both the domains. This is a challenging problem, since the probability distributions governing both the domains are substantially different leading to the violation of the probably approximate correct assumptions of statistical learning theory. We consider an even complex scenario in this letter by assuming the absence of source domain training samples in the learning process. Our algorithm broadly consists of two stages: first, data from both the domains are projected into a common subspace using geodesic flow kernel in a Grassmannian manifold, and we further propose an iterative coclustering technique to obtain the consistent clustering outcomes for both the domains in the newly defined space. In line with the traditional domain-adaptation approaches, we also consider that both the domains contain the same set of semantic land-cover classes. The proposed method is simple, scalable, and results in highly precise clustering outputs for standard RS data sets.",

The pursuit of innovative, multifunctional, more efficient, and safer treatments is a major challenge in preclinical nanoparticle-mediated thermotherapeutic research. Here, we report that iron oxide nanoparticles have the dual capacity to act as both magnetic and photothermal agents. We further explore every key aspect of this magnetophotothermal approach, choosing iron oxide nanocubes for their high efficiency for the magnetic hyperthermia modality itself. In aqueous suspension, the nanocubes' exposure to both: An alternating magnetic field and near-infrared laser irradiation (808 nm), defined as the DUAL-mode, amplifies the heating effect 2-to 5-fold by comparison with magnetic stimulation alone, yielding unprecedented heating powers (specific loss powers) up to 5000 W/g. In cancer cells, the laser excitation restores the optimal efficiency of magnetic hyperthermia, otherwise inhibited by intracellular confinement, resulting in a remarkable heating efficiency in the DUAL-mode (up to 15-fold amplification), with respect to the magnetophotothermal mode. As a consequence, the dual action yielded complete apoptosis-mediated cell death. In solid tumors in vivo, single-mode treatments (magnetic or laser hyperthermia) reduced tumor growth, while DUAL-mode treatment resulted in complete tumor regression, mediated by heat-induced tumoral cell apoptosis and massive denaturation of the collagen fibers, and a long-lasting thermal efficiency over repeated treatments.",

Ultrasound imaging is often used to guide the needle toward the target region in soft tissue. This task remains challenging due to the user’s dependence on image quality, limited field of view, moving target, and moving needle. In this paper, we present a novel dual-robot framework for robotic needle insertions under robotic ultrasound guidance. Method: We integrated force-controlled ultrasound image acquisition, registration of preoperative and intraoperative images, vision-based robot control, and target localization, in combination with a novel needle tracking algorithm. The framework allows robotic needle insertion to target a preoperatively defined region of interest while enabling real-time visualization and adaptive trajectory planning to provide safe and quick interactions. We assessed the framework by considering both static and moving targets embedded in water and tissue-mimicking gelatin. Results: The presented dual-robot tracking algorithms allow for accurate needle placement, namely to target the region of interest with an error around 1 mm. Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, we show the first use of two independent robots, one for imaging, the other for needle insertion, that are simultaneously controlled using image processing algorithms. Experimental results show the feasibility and demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the process.",

The realization of nanocomposite materials with topologically tailored composition and functional properties represents an important technological challenge for many applications such as optics and electronics. In the last years a great effort has been devoted to develop techniques that, by controlling the generation and the distribution of nanoparticles, allow the realization of structured metal/polymer nanocomposites. In this work we present a novel methodology for the realization of patterned silver/polymer nanocomposites generated in a polymeric matrix starting from a single formulation exploiting a fully photoinduced dual wavelength method, maintaining control over size distribution, with a straightforward influence on electronic/plasmonic/photonic properties. A step by step study of the process was carried out, investigating both the polymerization kinetics and the nanoparticles generation. Finally patterning in the polymeric matrix was performed through photolithographic technology and a washing process was developed in order to stabilize the material toward ageing. This technique opens new perspectives in the realization of multifunctional materials and devices exploiting electronic/plasmonic/photonic properties of the embedded nanoparticles and it is envisaged to be further improved by applying region-selective techniques.",

A comparison of these NCs with bulk Fe3O4-supported AuCu NCs showed that the nanosized support was far more effective in preventing the sintering of the metal domains, leading thus to a superior catalytic activity. Nanosizing of the support could be thus an effective, general strategy to improve the thermal stability of metallic NCs. On the other hand, the support size did not affect the chemical transformations experienced by the AuCu NCs during the activation step. Independently from the support size, we observed indeed the segregation of Cu from the alloy phase under oxidative conditions as well as the possible incorporation of the Cu atoms in the iron oxide domain.",

A detailed exam of the dynamical behavior of the two cells is presented in order to analyze the differences between planar and 3D-packed structures. Both the bacteria communities composition and MFCs electrical properties have been monitored over 31 days. The effects on the cell performances of the start-up phase, of the feeding operation and of an external applied resistance are discussed. The energy losses inside the MFCs along time, before and after refill of chemical solutions have been obtained by means of Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy. Results show that after 10 days of operations the total internal resistances decreased of about 30% and 50% for carbon felt and graphitized saddles anodes, respectively. The reduction of internal resistances is in agreement with improved performance in terms of power density. Moreover, for both MFCs the refill operation leads to a reduction of the impedances, in particular the anodic resistances decreases while the ohmic and the cathodic ones are quite unaffected. In addition, the energy production of the two devices was studied applying resistive loads for 10 days. The saddle-MFC presents more stable voltage values if compared to the other cell, implying a larger energy production over time. Finally, Quantitative real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction analysis, performed over the whole period of investigation on planktonic phase, reveals the presence of two typical electrogens bacteria, such as Geobacter and Shewanella.",

The presence of a Rashba band-splitting mechanism mediated by spin-orbit coupling and breaking of inversion symmetry has been suggested as a possible cause for the reduced recombination rates observed in organohalide perovskites. Here, we investigate the interplay of electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom in defining the Rashba splitting in realistic MAPbI3 models. Our simulations disclose a \"dynamical Rashba effect\", allowing for a quantification of its magnitude under thermal conditions. We find that even in globally centrosymmetric structures the dynamics of the coupled inorganic-organic degrees of freedom give rise to a spatially local Rashba effect which fluctuates on the subpicosecond time scale typical of the methylammonium cation dynamics. This effect is progressively quenched in globally centrosymmetric structures, likely representing the MAPbI3 perovskite at room temperature, on increasing the probed spatial scale up to 32 MAPbI3 units (∼3 nm size) because of the incoherent nuclear thermal motion mediated by the disorder of the organic cations.",

This paper presents a novel online walking control that replans the gait pattern based on our proposed foot placement control using the actual center of mass (COM) state feedback. The analytic solution of foot placement is formulated based on the linear inverted pendulum model (LIPM) to recover the walking velocity and to reject external disturbances. The foot placement control predicts where and when to place the foothold in order to modulate the gait given the desired gait parameters. The zero moment point (ZMP) references and foot trajectories are replanned online according to the updated foothold prediction. Hence, only desired gait parameters are required instead of predefined or fixed gait patterns. Given the new ZMP references, the extended prediction self-adaptive control (EPSAC) approach to model predictive control (MPC) is used to minimize the ZMP response errors considering the acceleration constraints. Furthermore, to ensure smooth gait transitions, the conditions for the gait initiation and termination are also presented. The effectiveness of the presented gait control is validated by extensive disturbance rejection studies ranging from single mass simulation to a full body humanoid robot COMAN in a physics based simulator. The versatility is demonstrated by the control of reactive gaits as well as reactive stepping from standing posture. We present the data of the applied disturbances, the prediction of sagittal/lateral foot placements, the replanning of the foot/ZMP trajectories, and the COM responses.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 Suzuki, Morimoto, Kiyono, Morasso and Nomura. Human postural sway during stance arises from coordinated multi-joint movements. Thus, a sway trajectory represented by a time-varying postural vector in the multiple-joint-angle-space tends to be constrained to a low-dimensional subspace. It has been proposed that the subspace corresponds to a manifold defined by a kinematic constraint, such that the position of the center of mass (CoM) of the whole body is constant in time, referred to as the kinematic uncontrolled manifold (kinematic-UCM). A control strategy related to this hypothesis (CoM-control-strategy) claims that the central nervous system (CNS) aims to keep the posture close to the kinematic-UCM using a continuous feedback controller, leading to sway patterns that mostly occur within the kinematic-UCM, where no corrective control is exerted. An alternative strategy proposed by the authors (intermittent control-strategy) claims that the CNS stabilizes posture by intermittently suspending the active feedback controller, in such a way to allow the CNS to exploit a stable manifold of the saddle-type upright equilibrium in the state-space of the system, referred to as the dynamic-UCM, when the state point is on or near the manifold. Although the mathematical definitions of the kinematic- and dynamic-UCM are completely different, both UCMs play similar roles in the stabilization of multi-joint upright posture. The purpose of this study was to compare the dynamic performance of the two control strategies. In particular, we considered a double-inverted-pendulum-model of postural control, and analyzed the two UCMs defined above. We first showed that the geometric configurations of the two UCMs are almost identical. We then investigated whether the UCM-component of experimental sway could be considered as passive dynamics with no active control, and showed that such UCM-component mainly consists of high frequency oscillations above 1 Hz, corresponding to anti-phase coordination between the ankle and hip. We also showed that this result can be better characterized by an eigenfrequency associated with the dynamic-UCM. In summary, our analysis highlights the close relationship between the two control strategies, namely their ability to simultaneously establish small CoM variations and postural stability, but also make it clear that the intermittent control hypothesis better explains the spectral characteristics of sway.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 Elsevier B.V.Plants are sessile organisms and need to acclimate to ever-changing light conditions in order to survive. These changes trigger a dynamic reorganization of the membrane protein complexes in the thylakoid membranes. Photosystem II (PSII) and its light harvesting system (LHCII) are the major target of this acclimation response, and accumulating evidences indicate that the amount and composition of PSII–LHCII supercomplexes in thylakoids are dynamically adjusted in response to changes in light intensity and quality. In this study, we characterized the PSII–LHCII supercomplexes in thylakoid membranes of pea plants in response to long-term acclimation to different light intensities. We provide evidence of a reorganization of the PSII–LHCII supercomplexes showing distinct changes in their antenna moiety. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed a specific reduction of Lhcb3, Lhcb6 and M-LHCII trimers bound to the PSII cores, while the Lhcb4.3 isoform increased in response to high light intensities. The modulation of Lhcb protein content correlates with the reduction of the functional PSII antenna size. These results suggest that the Lhcb3, Lhcb4.3 and Lhcb6 antenna subunits are major players in modulation of the PSII antenna size upon long-term acclimation to increased light levels. PsbS was not detected in the isolated PSII–LHCII supercomplexes at any light condition, despite an increased accumulation in thylakoids of high light acclimated plants, suggesting that PsbS is not a constitutive component of PSII–LHCII supercomplexes.",

The laser ablation mechanisms of metallic targets leading to liquid nanodroplet ejection are of wide interest both from a fundamental point of view and for applications in various fields, especially when nanoparticle synthesis is required. The phase explosion process was recognized as the driving mechanism of the expulsion of a mixture of vapor and liquid nanodroplets in the short pulse laser ablation of metals. A model based on thermodynamics that links the theory of homogeneous vapor bubble nucleation to the size distribution of the generated liquid nanoclusters has been recently proposed. The present work aims to take a step ahead to remove some assumptions made in previous work. Here an improved computational approach allows us to describe time-dependent nucleation in a homogeneous system with no temperature spatial gradients under nanosecond laser irradiation. Numerical results regarding the size distribution of formed liquid clusters and the time evolution of the process are shown for aluminum, iron, cobalt, nickel, copper, silver and gold. Connections with experimental data and molecular dynamics simulations, when available from literature, are reported and discussed.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 Elsevier B.V.This study aims at elucidating the effect of three-dimensional (3D) extracellular matrix on cell behaviour and nanoparticle (NP) diffusion and its consequences on NP cellular uptake mechansims. For this purpose, human dermal fibroblasts (HDF) and human fibrosarcoma (HT1080) cell lines were grown within a 3D collagen gel and exposed to model polystyrene (PS) NPs of controlled size (44 and 100 nm). Results indicate that, in 3D, cell morphology dramatically changes compared to standard 2D cultures and NP diffusion within the matrix is hampered by the interaction with the collagen fibres. As a consequence, NP cellular uptake, modeled with equations describing the stoichiometric exchange between NPs and cell membrane, is significantly slowed down in 3D and in the case of 100 nm NPs, in part due to the hampered diffusion of NPs in collagen gel compared to their transport in standard cell culture medium. Furthermore, our outcomes point at a significant contribution of the cytoskeleton assembly, in particular actin microfilaments, in governing the uptake of PS NPs in a 3D environment, and also that the macropinocytosis process is preserved and is mainly involved in the internalization of PS NPs in a 3D environment. However, depending on cell type and nanoparticle size, other endocytic pathways are also implicated when moving from 2D to 3D culture systems. This work highlights the importance of studying the nano-bio interaction in experimental models that resembles in vivo conditions in order to better predict the therapeutic efficacy of drug delivery systems.",

In particular, it is found that in the transient absorption spectra, under resonant excitation, the 1S transition bleaching band from uncoupled CdSe QDs is completely separated into two distinctive bleaching bands, remarkably fingerprinting the hybrid SPP-QD state. It was also found that the lifetime of these hybrid bands is just slightly shorter than the lifetime of bare CdSe QDs, possibly caused by the phonon bottleneck effect due to the large Rabi splitting.

In particular, the plasmonic response of the device has been tuned by modifying its periodicity thus to achieve the strongest possible coupling regime. It is found that in the transient absorption spectra, under upper band excitation, the bleaching signal from uncoupled J-aggregate molecules completely disappears. Instead, two distinctive period dependent bleaching bands are formed, clearly fingerprint of the hybrid exciton-plasmon state. The dynamics of these bands is also directly analyzed. A remarkable long lifetime is found especially for the upper band, corresponding to the presence of a trap state in its transient absorption spectra under resonance excitation.

Here we develop a perturbation approach for weakly nonidentical ensembles. We calculate corrections to the WS dynamics for two types of perturbations: those due to a distribution of natural frequencies and of forcing terms, and those due to small white noise. We demonstrate that in both cases, the complex mean field for which the dynamical equations are written is close to the Kuramoto order parameter, up to the leading order in the perturbation. This supports the validity of the dynamical reduction suggested by Ott and Antonsen (2008 Chaos 18 037113) for weakly inhomogeneous populations.",

Children performed 2 spatial tasks (minimum audible angle and space bisection) and 1 temporal task (temporal bisection). There was no impairment in the temporal task for blind children but, like adults, they showed severely compromised thresholds for spatial bisection. Interestingly, the blind children also showed lower precision in judging minimum audible angle. These results confirm the adult study and go on to suggest that even simpler auditory spatial tasks are compromised in children, and that this capacity recovers over time.",

In this work, we demonstrate the feasibility of micrometric asymmetric reservoirs made of thermoplastic polymers by using the gas foaming method, which has been recently introduced, and consists in forming bubbles in micro- or nano-metric bulk particles as is done with carbonated drinks. As this simplicity anticipates, this represents a breakthrough in the area of micro- and nanoparticles as it responds to the needs of: (i) breaking the symmetry of commonly available systems, (ii) filling the particles with a multitude of host molecules and solutions, (iii) having different shapes, (iv) having a wide range of particle dimensions, (v) having particles made of a wide range of materials. Here we report the achievement of micrometric spherical particles and of micrometric ellipsoidal particles with eccentric holes, filled with crystal violet or with quantum dots as model host molecules. Raman spectroscopy and optical and electron imaging are utilized to verify the effectiveness of the method. This study should open up the use of micro- and nano-metric reservoirs in a multitude of research areas, from biomedicine and pharmacology, to electronics, energy and optics.",

Their fusion can,in fact,shed new light on brain functions. Targeting this issue,the manuscript proposes a constrained autoregressive model allowing to generate an “effective” connectivity matrix that model the structural connectivity integrating the functional activity. In practice,an initial structural connectivity representation is altered according to functional data,by minimizing the reconstruction error of an autoregressive model constrained by the structural prior. The proposed model has been tested in a community detection framework,where the brain is partitioned using the effective network across multiple subjects. Results showed that using the effective connectivity the resulting clusters better describe the functional interactions of different regions while maintaining the structural organization.",

The electromagnetic energy of visible light can be localized inside nanostructures below the diffraction limit by converting the optical modes into nonradiative surface plasmon resonances. The energy of the confined photons is correlated to the size and shape of the nanostructured system. In this work, we studied the photoluminescence dependence of aggregates of 14 nm diameter gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) synthesized by drop-casting a liquid suspension on two different substrates of glass and quartz. The AuNP aggregates were characterized by electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The dielectric constant of the surrounding medium plays a crucial role in determining the aggregate geometry, which affects the Anderson localization of light in the aggregates and hence causes a red-shift in the plasmonic resonance and in the photoluminescence emission. The geometry of the gold nanoparticle aggregates determine the strength of the Anderson localization, and hence, the light emission from the aggregates. The photoluminescence lifetime was found to be dependent on the AuNP aggregate geometry and the dielectric constant of the medium.",

The aim of the present work is to evaluate the anti-proliferative effect of the oil extracted from seeds of A. spinosa in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia human (T-ALL) context. The activity was assessed through an in vitro test on three T-ALL cell lines: JURKAT, MOLT3 and DND41. The cytotoxicity effects of A. spinosa oil extract were checked by MTT assay and the change in the activity levels of two T-ALL proliferation-related proteins (Notch1 and ERK) was investigated by Western blot, the results demonstrate that treatment with A. spinosa oil extract at the dose of 100 μg/mL inhibited the growth of JURKAT, MOLT3 and DND41 cells, and reduced the expression levels and the activity of proliferation-related proteins such as ERK1/2 and Notch1 intracellular domain. A. spinosa oil extract could be a potential preventive and therapeutic approach recommended as anti-proliferative against leukemia.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 American Chemical Society. Two-color emitting colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs) are of interest for applications in multimodal imaging, sensing, lighting, and integrated photonics. Dual color emission from core- and shell-related optical transitions has been recently obtained using so-called dot-in-bulk (DiB) CdSe/CdS NCs comprising a quantum-confined CdSe core embedded into an ultrathick (∼7-9 nm) CdS shell. The physical mechanism underlying this behavior is still under debate. While a large shell volume appears to be a necessary condition for dual emission, comparison between various types of thick-shell CdSe/CdS NCs indicates a critical role of the interface \"sharpness\" and the presence of potential barriers. To elucidate the effect of the interface morphology on the dual emission, we perform side-by-side studies of CdSe/CdS DiB-NCs with nominally identical core and shell dimensions but different structural properties of the core/shell interface arising from the crystal structure of the starting CdSe cores (zincblende vs wurtzite). While both structures exhibit dual emission under comparable pump intensities, NCs with a zincblende core show a faster growth of shell luminescence with excitation fluence and a more readily realized regime of amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) even under \"slow\" nanosecond excitation. These distinctions can be linked to the structure of the core/shell interface: NCs grown from the zincblende cores contain a ∼3.5 nm thick zincblende CdS interlayer, which separates the core from the wurtzite CdS shell and creates a potential barrier for photoexcited shell holes inhibiting their relaxation into the core. This helps maintain a higher population of shell states and simplifies the realization of dual emission and ASE involving shell-based optical transitions.",

Systematic mechanical measurements were conducted to investigate the effect of GnP thickness and lateral size on the elastic moduli. Comparisons were made with other reinforcing nanostructured filers such as organoclay, MoS2, Fe2O3, carbon black and silica nanoparticles. Upon solvent casting, GnPs did not perform better than the other model fillers in increasing the elastic modulus of the soft bio-polyester. Upon hot-pressing however, large (&gt;300 nm) multi-layer GnPs (≥8 layers) more than doubled the elastic modulus of the soft bio-polyester matrix compared to other GnPs and fillers. This effect was attributed to the optimized alignment of the large 2D GnP flakes within the amorphous soft polymer. In contrast, hot-pressing did not yield superior elastic modulus enhancement for the hard bio-polyester when hot-pressed. GnPs only induced 30% enhancement for both processes. Moreover, multi-layer large GnPs were shown to suppress the thermally-induced stiffness reduction of the soft bio-polyester near its melting temperature. A theoretical analysis based on the spring network model is deployed to describe the impact of the GnP alignment on the elastic moduli enhancement.",

One type of graphite nanoplatelets (GNP) and two different grades of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) were used. Furthermore, high temperature annealing treatment under vacuum at 1700 °C was carried out on both RGO to reduce their defectiveness and study the correlation between the electrical/thermal properties of the nanocomposites and the nanoflakes structure/defectiveness. The morphology and quality of the nanomaterials were investigated by means of electron microscopy, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, thermogravimetry and Raman spectroscopy. Thermal, mechanical and electrical properties of the nanocomposites were investigated by means of rheology, dynamic mechanical thermal analysis, volumetric resistivity and thermal conductivity measurements. Physical properties of nanocomposites were correlated with the structure and defectiveness of nanoflakes, evidencing a strong dependence of properties on nanoflakes structure and defectiveness. In particular, a significant enhancement of both thermal and electrical conductivities was demonstrated upon the reduction of nanoflakes defectiveness.",

We aimed to characterize the work function of clusters resulting from gold nanocrystals capped with oleylamine surfactant and drop-casted onto gold substrate. We used scanning Kelvin probe microscopy to investigate the work function, and complemented our study mainly with X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The oleylamine works as an electron blocking layer through which the electrical conduction takes place by tunneling effect. The surface potential appears to depend on the size of the clusters, which can be ascribed to their difference in effective work function with the substrate. The charge state of gold clusters is discussed in comparison with theory, and their capacitance is calculated from a semi-analytical equation. The results suggest that at the nanoscale the work function is not an intrinsic property of a material but rather depends on the size and morphology of the clusters, including also effects of the surrounding materials.",

However, for the majority of the materials employed, the studies are focused on sophisticated surface treatments while the significant role of the morphological parameters of the porous structure of the pristine foams remains unexplored. Herein, we prove that the structural parameters of the pores of the polymeric foams play a fundamental role for the efficient removal of oil from water. The presented experimental and theoretical study shows that pristine polyurethane foams with highly interconnected open porous structures, and pore sizes below 500 μm are able to reach oil absorption capacities as high as 30 gr of oil per gr of polyurethane. Chemical functionalization of the porous structure does not increase further the oil absorption efficiency but it significantly contributes to the increase of the selectivity of the process. The current findings demonstrate the importance of the right choice of the pristine foams for the fabrication of cost-effective absorbents with high water-oil separation performance.",

This technique was demonstrated to allow thermal characterization of the flakes with a spatial resolution of the order of a few tens of nanometers, while recording nanoscale topography at the same time. Several individual RGO flakes were analyzed by SThM, both as obtained after conventional thermal reduction and after a subsequent annealing at 1700 °C. Significant differences in the thermal maps were observed between pristine and annealed flakes, reflecting higher heat dissipation on annealed RGO flakes compared with pristine ones. This result was correlated with the reduction of RGO structure defectiveness. In particular, a substantial reduction of oxidized groups and sp3 carbons upon annealing was proven by X-ray photoelectron and Raman spectroscopies, while the increase of crystalline order was demonstrated by X-ray diffraction, in terms of higher correlation lengths both along and perpendicular to the graphene planes. Results presented in this paper provide experimental evidence for the qualitative correlation between the defectiveness of graphene-related materials and their thermal conductivity, which is clearly crucial for the exploitation of these materials into thermally conductive nanocomposites.",

            "abstract": "© 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg (outside the USA). Rationale: Manipulations of the endocannabinoid system could potentially produce therapeutic effects with minimal risk of adverse cannabis-like side effects. Inhibitors of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) increase endogenous levels of the cannabinoid-receptor agonist, anandamide, and show promise for treating a wide range of disorders. However, their effects on learning and memory have not been fully characterized. Objectives: We determined the effects of five structurally different FAAH inhibitors in an animal model of working memory known to be sensitive to impairment by delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Methods: A delayed nonmatching-to-position procedure was used in rats. Illuminated nosepoke holes were used to provide sample cues (left versus right) and record responses (correct versus incorrect) after delays ranging from 0 to 28 s. Various test drugs were given acutely up to two times per week before daily sessions. Results: One FAAH inhibitor, AM3506 (3 mg/kg), decreased accuracy in the memory task. Four other FAAH inhibitors (URB597, URB694, PF-04457845, and ARN14633) and a monoacylglycerol lipase inhibitor (JZL184, which blocks the degradation of the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol) had no effect. Testing of AM3506 in combination with antagonists for receptors known to be affected by anandamide and other fatty acid amides indicated that the impairment induced by AM3506 was mediated by cannabinoid CB1 receptors, and not by alpha-type peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR-alpha) or vanilloid transient receptor potential cation channels (TRPV1). Conclusions: FAAH inhibitors differ with respect to their potential for memory impairment, abuse liability, and probably other cannabis-like effects, and they should be evaluated individually for specific therapeutic and adverse effects.",

Human and experimental studies have revealed putative neuroprotective and pro-cognitive effects of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) in aging, evidencing positive correlations between peripheral n-3 PUFA levels and regional grey matter (GM) volume, as well as negative correlations between dietary n-3 PUFA levels and cognitive deficits. We recently showed that n-3 PUFA supplemented aged mice exhibit better hippocampal-dependent mnesic functions, along with enhanced cellular plasticity and reduced neurodegeneration, thus supporting a role of n-3 PUFA supplementation in preventing cognitive decline during aging. To corroborate these initial results and develop new evidence on the effects of n-3 PUFA supplementation on brain substrates at macro-scale level, here we expanded behavioral analyses to the emotional domain (anxiety and coping skills), and carried out a fine-grained regional GM volumetric mapping by using high-resolution MRI-based voxel-based morphometry. The behavioral effects of 8 week n-3 PUFA supplementation were measured on cognitive (discriminative, spatial and social) and emotional (anxiety and coping) abilities of aged (19 month-old at the onset of study) C57B6/J mice. n-3 PUFA supplemented mice showed better mnesic performances as well as increased active coping skills. Importantly, these effects were associated with enlarged regional hippocampal, retrosplenial and prefrontal GM volumes, and with increased post mortem n-3 PUFA brain levels. These findings indicate that increased dietary n-3 PUFA intake in normal aging can improve fronto-hippocampal GM structure and function, an effect present also when the supplementation starts at late age. Our data are consistent with a protective role of n-3 PUFA supplementation in counteracting cognitive decline, emotional dysfunctions and brain atrophy.",

Huntington’s disease (HD) is a fatal, dominantly inherited, neurodegenerative disorder due to a pathological expansion of the CAG repeat in the coding region of the HTT gene. In the quest for understanding the molecular basis of neurodegeneration, we have previously demonstrated that the prolyl isomerase Pin1 plays a crucial role in mediating p53-dependent apoptosis triggered by mutant huntingtin (mHtt) in vitro. To assess the effects of the lack of Pin1 in vivo, we have bred Pin1 knock-out mice with HdhQ111 knock-in mice, a genetically precise model of HD. We show that Pin1 genetic ablation modifies a portion of HdhQ111 phenotypes in a time-dependent fashion. As an early event, Pin1 activity reduces the DNA damage response (DDR). In midlife mice, by taking advantage of next-generation sequencing technology, we show that Pin1 activity modulates a portion of the alterations triggered by mHtt, extending the role of Pin1 to two additional HdhQ111 phenotypes: the unbalance in the “synthesis/concentration of hormones”, as well as the alteration of “Wnt/β-catenin signaling”. In aging animals, Pin1 significantly increases the number of mHtt-positive nuclear inclusions while it reduces gliosis. In summary, this work provides further support for a role of Pin1 in HD pathogenesis.",

To develop greener protocols toward the sustainable production of conjugated polymers, we combine the advantages of atom-economic direct arylation polycondensation (DAP) with those of the green solvent 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (MeTHF). The n-type copolymer PNDIT2 is synthesized from unsubstituted bithiophene (T2) and 2,6-dibromonapthalene diimide (NDIBr2) under simple DAP conditions in MeTHF. Extensive optimization is required to suppress nucleophilic substitution of NDIBr end groups, which severely limits molar mass. Different carboxylic acids, bases, palladium precursors and ligands are successfully screened to enable quantitative yield and satisfyingly high molar masses up to Mn,SEC ∼ 20 kDa. In contrast to PNDIT2 made via DAP in toluene with tolyl-chain termini, nucleophilic substitution of NDIBr chain ends in MeTHF finally leads to NDI-OH termination. The influence of different chain termini on the optical, thermal, structural and electronic properties of PNDIT2 is investigated. For samples with identical molecular weight, OH-termination leads to slightly reduced aggregation in solution and bulk crystallinity, a decreased degree of alignment in directionally deposited films, and a consequently reduced, but not compromised, electron mobility with promising values still close to 0.9 cm2 V-1 s-1.",

However, the adoption of these advances for multi-finger tactile rendering of dexterous grasping and manipulation is hampered by the computational cost incurred with nonlinear skin models when applied to the full hand. We have observed that classic constrained dynamics solvers, typically designed for contact mechanics, fail to perform efficiently on deformation constraints of nonlinear skin models. In this paper, we propose a novel constrained dynamics solver designed to perform well with highly nonlinear deformation constraints. In practice, we achieve more than 10x speed-up over previous approaches, and as a result we enable multi-finger tactile rendering of manipulation actions that capture the nonlinearity of skin.",

Here we observe by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) a coupling-induced Dirac cone renormalization when depositing small amounts of Ti onto epitaxial graphene on SiC. We obtain a remarkably high doping efficiency and a readily tunable carrier velocity simply by changing the amount of deposited Ti. First-principles theoretical calculations show that a strong lateral (non-vertical) orbital coupling leads to an efficient doping of graphene by hybridizing the 2pz orbital of graphene and the 3d orbitals of the Ti adsorbate, which attached on graphene without creating any trap/scattering states. This Ti-induced hybridization is adsorbate-specific and has major consequences for efficient doping as well as applications towards adsorbate-induced modification of carrier transport in graphene.",

The UV-Vis spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) results show that longer tail length surfactants act as shape-directing agents promoting diversified morphologies. The formation of multiple-shaped Au nanoparticles, such as round, hexagonal, pentagonal, triangular and rod-like, has been confirmed from microstructure analysis; among them, many triangular shapes enhanced at elevated levels of surfactant concentration. In addition, the triangular Au nanoparticles with truncated corners were changed to smooth corners as the hydrocarbon chain length increased from (18-2-18) to (20-2-20). The concentration and hydrocarbon tails of twin-tail surfactants strongly influence the size and structure of Au NPs. In addition, the Au NPs synthesized with the twin-tail surfactant (18-2-18) were found to be highly sensitive towards Hg2+, which could be because of the preferential adsorption of Hg0 on the lower energy facets of triangular-shaped Au NPs.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd. Coronary angioplasty is the most widely used technique for removing atherosclerotic plaques in blood vessels. The regeneration of the damaged intima layer after this treatment is still one of the major challenges in the field of cardiovascular tissue engineering. Different polymers have been used in scaffold manufacturing in order to improve tissue regeneration. Elastin-mimetic polymers are a new class of molecules that have been synthesized and used to obtain small diameter fibers with specific morphological characteristics. Elastin-like polymers produced by recombinant techniques and called elastin-like recombinamers (ELRs) are particularly promising due to their high degree of functionalization. Generally speaking, ELRs can show more complex molecular designs and a tighter control of their sequence than other chemically synthetized polymers Rodriguez Cabello et al (2009 Polymer 50 5159-69, 2011 Nanomedicine 6 111-22). For the fabrication of small diameter fibers, different ELRs were dissolved in 2,2,2-fluoroethanol (TFE). Dynamic light scattering was used to identify the transition temperature and get a deep characterization of the transition behavior of the recombinamers. In this work, we describe the use of electrospinning technique for the manufacturing of an elastic fibrous scaffold; the obtained fibers were characterized and their cytocompatibility was tested in vitro. A thorough study of the influence of voltage, flow rate and distance was carried out in order to determine the appropriate parameters to obtain fibrous mats without beads and defects. Moreover, using a rotating mandrel, we fabricated a tubular scaffold in which ELRs containing different cell adhesion sequences (mainly REDV and RGD) were collected. The stability of the scaffold was improved by using genipin as a crosslinking agent. Genipin-ELRs crosslinked scaffolds show a good stability and fiber morphology. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were used to assess the in vitro bioactivity of the cell adhesion domains within the backbone of the ELRs.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 Amin, Maccione, Marinaro, Zordan, Nieus and Berdondini. The recent availability of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) holds great promise as a novel source of human-derived neurons for cell and tissue therapies as well as for in vitro drug screenings that might replace the use of animal models. However, there is still a considerable lack of knowledge on the functional properties of hiPSC-derived neuronal networks, thus limiting their application. Here, upon optimization of cell culture protocols, we demonstrate that both spontaneous and evoked electrical spiking activities of these networks can be characterized on-chip by taking advantage of the resolution provided by CMOS multielectrode arrays (CMOS-MEAs). These devices feature a large and closely-spaced array of 4096 simultaneously recording electrodes and multi-site on-chip electrical stimulation. Our results show that networks of human-derived neurons can respond to electrical stimulation with a physiological repertoire of spike waveforms after 3 months of cell culture, a period of time during which the network undergoes the expression of developing patterns of spontaneous spiking activity. To achieve this, we have investigated the impact on the network formation and on the emerging network-wide functional properties induced by different biochemical substrates, i.e., poly-dl-ornithine (PDLO), poly-l-ornithine (PLO), and polyethylenimine (PEI), that were used as adhesion promoters for the cell culture. Interestingly, we found that neuronal networks grown on PDLO coated substrates show significantly higher spontaneous firing activity, reliable responses to low-frequency electrical stimuli, and an appropriate level of PSD-95 that may denote a physiological neuronal maturation profile and synapse stabilization. However, our results also suggest that even 3-month culture might not be sufficient for human-derived neuronal network maturation. Taken together, our results highlight the tight relationship existing between substrate coatings and emerging network properties, i.e., spontaneous activity, responsiveness, synapse formation and maturation. Additionally, our results provide a baseline on the functional properties expressed over 3 months of network development for a commercially available line of hiPSC-derived neurons. This is a first step toward the development of functional pre-clinical assays to test pharmaceutical compounds on human-derived neuronal networks with CMOS-MEAs.",

An electric field is employed for the active tuning of the structural colour in photonic crystals, which acts as an effective external stimulus with an impact on light transmission manipulation. In this work, we demonstrate structural colour in a photonic crystal device comprised of alternating layers of silver nanoparticles and titanium dioxide nanoparticles, exhibiting spectral shifts of around 10 nm for an applied voltage of only 10 V. The accumulation of charge at the metal/dielectric interface with an applied electric field leads to an effective increase of the charges contributing to the plasma frequency in silver. This initiates a blue shift of the silver plasmon band with a simultaneous blue shift of the photonic band gap as a result of the change in the silver dielectric function (i.e. decrease of the effective refractive index). These results are the first demonstration of active colour tuning in silver/titanium dioxide nanoparticle-based photonic crystals and open the route to metal/dielectric-based photonic crystals as electro-optic switches.",

Moreover, photocatalysis is often easily controllable and does not generally require a continuous feed of reactants as in ordinary chemical abatement. In this work, we have investigated the photocatalytic dissociation of lactose present in milk whey under ultraviolet irradiation of a titanium dioxide substrate produced by anodic oxidation of metallic titanium. Two different forms of photocatalyst have been tested, namely a crude titania electrolytically obtained without any other further surface restructuring and a titania with surface modified by thermal annealing. The results proved the beneficial effects of a surface restructuring in terms of reaction yield. Such results can be interpreted as a preliminary test being a starting point for further surface treatments and process optimization.",

The dehydration reactions of minerals in subduction zones strongly control geological processes, such as arc volcanism, earthquakes, serpentinization, or geochemical transport of incompatible elements. In aluminum-bearing systems, chlorite is considered the most important hydrous phase at the top of the subducting plate, and significant amount of water is released after its decomposition. However, the dehydration mechanism is not fully understood, and additional hydrates are stabilized by the presence of Al beyond the stability field of chlorite. We applied here a cutting-edge analytical approach to characterize the experimental rocks synthesized at the high pressures and temperatures matching with deep subduction conditions in the upper mantle. Fast electron diffraction tomography and high-resolution synchrotron X-ray diffraction allowed the identification and the successful structure solution of two new hydrous phases formed as dehydration product of chlorite. The 11.5 Å phase, Mg6Al(OH)7(SiO4)2, is a hydrous layer structure. It presents incomplete tetrahedral sheets and face-sharing magnesium and aluminum octahedra. The structure has a higher Mg/Si ratio compared to chlorite, and a significantly higher density (ρ0 = 2.93 g/cm3) and bulk modulus [K0 = 108.3(8) GPa], and it incorporates 13 wt% of water. The HySo phase, Mg3Al(OH)3(Si2O7), is a dense layered sorosilicate, [ρ0 = 3.13 g/cm3 and K0 = 120.6(6) GPa] with an average water content of 8.5 wt%. These phases indicate that water release process is highly complex, and may proceed with multistep dehydration, involving these layer structures whose features well match the high-shear zones present at the slab-mantle wedge interface.",

In highly viscous electron systems such as high-quality graphene above liquid nitrogen temperature, a linear response to applied electric current becomes essentially nonlocal, which can give rise to a number of new and counterintuitive phenomena including negative nonlocal resistance and current whirlpools. It has also been shown that, although both effects originate from high electron viscosity, a negative voltage drop does not principally require current backflow. In this work, we study the role of geometry on viscous flow and show that confinement effects and relative positions of injector and collector contacts play a pivotal role in the occurrence of whirlpools. Certain geometries may exhibit backflow at arbitrarily small values of the electron viscosity, whereas others require a specific threshold value for whirlpools to emerge.",

This is particularly true for the novel class of perovskite solar cells. Accurate theoretical modelling can help establish general trends of behavior when addressing structural changes. Here, we consider the effects due to halide substitution in organohalide CH3NH3PbX3 perovskites exploring the halide series with X = Cl, Br, I. For this task, we use accurate DFT and GW methods including spin-orbit coupling. We find the expected band gap increase when moving from X = I to Cl, in line with the experimental data. Most notably, the calculated absorption coefficients for I, Br and Cl are nicely reproducing the behavior reported experimentally. A common feature of all the simulated band structures is a significant Rashba effect. This is similar for MAPbI3 and MAPbBr3 while MAPbCl3 shows in general a reduced Rashba interaction coefficient. Finally, a monotonic increase of the exciton reduced masses is calculated when moving from I to Br to Cl, in line with the stronger excitonic character of the lighter perovskite halides.",

Under electronic resonance conditions, the cross section can be selectively enhanced enabling structural sensitivity to specific chromophores and reaction centers. The addition of an ultrashort, broadband femtosecond pulse to the excitation field allows for coherent stimulation of diverse molecular vibrations. Within such a scheme, vibrational spectra are engraved onto a highly directional field, and can be heterodyne detected overwhelming fluorescence and other incoherent signals. At variance with spontaneous resonance Raman, however, interpreting the spectral information is not straightforward, due to the manifold of field interactions concurring to the third order nonlinear response. Taking as an example vibrational spectra of heme proteins excited in the Soret band, we introduce a general approach to extract the stimulated Raman excitation profiles from complex spectral lineshapes. Specifically, by a quantum treatment of the matter through density matrix description of the third order nonlinear polarization, we identify the contributions which generate the Raman bands, by taking into account for the cross section of each process.",

In this study, we analyze the photophysics of the N-methyl-6-oxyquinolinium betaine (MQ) solvatochromic dye in aqueous solution, focussing on the important structural rearrangement of its first solvation shell following the electronic excitation, which is characterized by a strong charge transfer. To this aim, we compare the results provided by ground- and excited-state ab-initio molecular dynamics with that of full QM calculations on clusters including a small number of solvent molecules (from 1 to 4), taking into account bulk solvent effects by the Polarizable Continuum Model. The two methods agree in predicting that while in the ground electronic state between three and four water molecules are strongly coordinated to the oxygen atom of MQ, in the excited state two water molecules are present in the first solvation layer of the MQ oxygen. Vertical excitation and emission energies computed on the structures provided by the two approaches allow for estimates of the Stokes shift consistent with the experimental results. On the ground of the present results, some general considerations on the advantages and limitations of the dynamical and static approaches in describing a photoactivated process in solution are proposed.",

We report on the ability to control the dynamics of a single peptide capture and passage across a voltage-biased, α-hemolysin nanopore (α-HL), under conditions that the electroosmotic force exerted on the analyte dominates the electrophoretic transport. We demonstrate that by extending outside the nanopore, the electroosmotic force is able to capture a peptide at either the lumen or vestibule entry of the nanopore, and transiently traps it inside the nanopore, against the electrophoretic force. Statistical analysis of the resolvable dwell-times of a metastable trapped peptide, as it occupies either the β-barrel or vestibule domain of the α-HL nanopore, reveals rich kinetic details regarding the direction and rates of stochastic movement of a peptide inside the nanopore. The presented approach demonstrates the ability to shuttle and study molecules along the passage pathway inside the nanopore, allows to identify the mesoscopic trajectory of a peptide exiting the nanopore through either the vestibule or β-barrel moiety, thus providing convincing proof of a molecule translocating the pore. The kinetic analysis of a peptide fluctuating between various microstates inside the nanopore, enabled a detailed picture of the free energy description of its interaction with the α-HL nanopore. When studied at the limit of vanishingly low transmembrane potentials, this provided a thermodynamic description of peptide reversible binding to and within the α-HL nanopore, under equilibrium conditions devoid of electric and electroosmotic contributions.",

The autobiographical IAT (aIAT) is an implicit behavioral instrument that can detect autobiographical memories encoded in an individual’s mind by measuring how quickly this person can categorize and associate sentences related to a specific event with the logical dimensions true and false. Faster categorization when an event (e.g., I went to Paris) is associated with the dimension true than false indicates that that specific event is encoded as true in the individual’s mind. The aim of this study is to investigate the electrophysiological correlates of the aIAT, used as a memory-detection technique (i.e., to identify which of two events is true). To this end, we recorded ERPs while participants performed an aIAT assessing which of two playing cards they had previously selected.We found an increased N200 and a decreased LPC (or P300) at the fronto-central sites when participants associated the selected playing card with the dimension false than true. Notably, both components have been previously and consistently reported in studies investigating deception. These results suggest that associating a true autobiographical event with the concept of false may involve the same cognitive processes associated with deception.",

This chapter demonstrates that pectin plays a major role in the structure-properties relationship of the composite nanofibers, even at a very small amount of 2. wt% pectin to PVA. Pectin caused an apparent increase in crystallinity, which can be further improved by post-spinning treatments of the nanofibers. Scanning electron microscope confirmed that the composite nanofibers are uniform and free of microbeads, and have a smaller diameter, which is probably due to the increase in crystallinity and the stretching caused by the higher charge density. These results suggest that the crystallinity of the PVA nanofibers can be modified by adding a small amount of pectin. PVA that is able to form nucleation and crystallization with pectin could serve to develop biodegradable and biocompatible, low-cost composite nanofibers for applications in biomedicine and material science.",

Thus, we include research pertaining to developmental robotics, cognitive science, psychology, linguistics and neuroscience, as well as practical computer science and engineering. The different studies are not at this stage all connected into a cohesive whole; rather, they are presented to illuminate the need for multiple different approaches that complement each other in the pursuit of understanding cognitive development in robots. Extensive experiments involving the humanoid robot iCub are reported, while human learning relevant to developmental robotics has also contributed useful results. Disparate approaches are brought together via common underlying design principles. Without claiming to model human language acquisition directly, we are nonetheless inspired by analogous development in humans and consequently, our investigations include the parallel co-development of action, conceptualization and social interaction.

This article presents the results of a multidisciplinary project where mechatronic engineers worked alongside biologists to develop a soft robotic arm that captures key features of octopus anatomy and neurophysiology. The concept of embodiment (the dynamic coupling between sensory-motor control, anatomy, materials and environment that allows for the animal to achieve adaptive behaviours) is used as a starting point for the design process but tempered by current engineering technologies and approaches. In this article, the embodied design requirements are first discussed from a robotic viewpoint by taking into account real-life engineering limitations; then, the motor control schemes inspired by octopus nervous system are investigated. Finally, the mechanical and control design of a prototype is presented that appropriately blends bio-inspiration and engineering limitations. Simulated and experimental results show that the developed continuum robotic arm is able to reproduce octopus-like motions for bending, reaching and grasping.",

To date, the main focus of applied research is to tune its optical properties, which is usually done via doping and/or nanoengineering. However, understanding the role of d electrons in materials and possible functionalization of d-electron properties are still major challenges. Herewith, within a combination of an innovative experimental technique, high-energy optical conductivity, and state-of-the-art ab initio electronic structure calculations, we report an emerging, novel resonant exciton in the deep ultraviolet region of the optical response. The resonant exciton evolves upon low-concentration Ta substitution in anatase TiO2 films. It is surprisingly robust and related to strong electron-electron and electron-hole interactions. The d- and f-orbital localization, due to Ta substitution, plays an unexpected role, activating strong electronic correlations and dominating the optical response under photoexcitation. Our results shed light on a new optical phenomenon in anatase TiO2 films and on the possibility of tuning electronic properties by Ta substitution.",

Individuals who experience life-threatening psychological trauma are at risk of developing a series of chronic neuropsychiatric pathologies that include generalized anxiety, depression, and drug addiction. The endocannabinoid system has been implicated in the modulation of these responses by regulating the activity of the amygdala and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. However, the relevance of this signaling complex to the long-term consequences of traumatic events is unclear. Here we use an animal model of predatory stress-induced anxiety-like behavior to investigate the role of the endocannabinoid system in the development of persistent anxiety states. Our main finding is that rats exposed to the fox pheromone 2,5-dihydro-2,4,5-trimethylthiazoline (TMT), a life-threatening stimulus for rodents, display a marked and selective increase in the mobilization of the endocannabinoid, 2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycerol (2-AG), in the amygdala. This effect lasts for at least 14 days after the stress has occurred. In addition, systemic or local pharmacological inhibition of monoacylglycerol lipase (MGL)-a lipid hydrolase that degrades 2-AG in presynaptic nerve terminals-elevates 2-AG levels and suppresses the anxiety-like behavior elicited by exposure to TMT. The results suggest that predator threat triggers long-term changes in 2-AG-mediated endocannabinoid signaling in the amygdala, and that pharmacological interventions targeting MGL might provide a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of chronic brain disorders initiated by trauma.",

Three-dimensional constructs formed by cells embedded in an exogenous scaffold could not represent a faithful in vitro replica of native and functional tissues. In this work we produced an endogenous human skin equivalent by means of a tissue engineering process that induces the full morphogenesis of functional dermal and epidermal compartments. In such an organotypic context we demonstrated that -by using adult human skin cells-it is possible to generate follicle-like structures in vitro resembling what occurs in vivo in the fetal skin. Immunotypization evidences an inward-oriented differentiation of the follicular-like structures through immunopositivity for epithelial stem cell markers such as p63 and K19. Moreover we detected the presence of versican within the intricate network of the dermal compartment, suggesting its role as an inductive factor for the morphogenesis of appendage-like structures. These results support the importance of the repository and regulatory role of the endogenous extra cellular matrix in guiding tissue morphogenesis. The microenvironment provided by the endogenous human skin equivalent preserves p63 and K19 positive cells and could finally be involved in: (i) triggering the arrangement of the keratinocytes in follicle-like structures; (ii) promoting the convolute profile of the derma-epidermal junction and (iii) improving epidermis barrier function. We argue that the nature of dermal compartment plays a role in directing epithelial cell fate and function in vitro.",

Here we show that genetic or pharmacological disruption of FAAH activity accelerates skin wound healing in mice and stimulates motogenesis of human keratinocytes and differentiation of human fibroblasts in primary cultures. Using untargeted and targeted lipidomics strategies, we identify two longchain saturated NATs-N- Tetracosanoyl- Taurine [NAT(24:0)] and N-eicosanoyl- Taurine [NAT(20:0)]- As primary substrates for FAAH in mouse skin, and show that the levels of these substances sharply decrease at the margins of a freshly inflicted wound to increase again as healing begins. Additionally, we demonstrate that local administration of synthetic NATs accelerates wound closure in mice and stimulates repair- Associated responses in primary cultures of human keratinocytes and fibroblasts, through a mechanism that involves tyrosine phosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor receptor and an increase in intracellular calcium levels, under the permissive control of transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 receptors.

In the in vitro model here proposed we used the bEnd3 cell line as brain endothelial cells to mimic the blood brain barrier (BBB) cultured on dextran microbeads ranging from 67 μm to 80 μm in size (Cytodex) and the primary human umbilical vein cells (HUVEC) for comparison. The revealed affinity between transferrin (Tf) and transferrin receptor (TfR) in both systems is very high, Kd values are in the order of nM. Conversely, the value of TfRs/cell reveals a 100-fold increase in the number of TfRs per bEnd3 cells compared to HUVEC cells. The presented methodology can represent a novel and helpful strategy to identify targets, to address drug design and selectively deliver therapeutics that can cross biological barriers such as the blood brain barrier.",

The in vitro fabrication of an endogenous cardiac muscle would have a high impact for both in vitro studies concerning cardiac tissue physiology and pathology, as well as in vivo application to potentially repair infarcted myocardium. To reach this aim, we engineered a new class of cardiac tissue precursor (CTP), specifically conceived in order to promote the synthesis and the assembly of a cardiac extracellular matrix (ECM). The CTPs were obtained by culturing a mixed cardiac cell population, composed of myocyte and non-myocyte cells, into porous gelatin microspheres in a dynamic bioreactor. By engineering the culture conditions, the CTP developed both beating properties and an endogenous immature cardiac ECM. By following a bottom-up approach, a macrotissue was fabricated by molding and packing the engineered tissue precursor in a maturation chamber. During the macrotissue formation, the tissue precursors acted as cardiac tissue depots by promoting the formation of an endogenous and interconnected cardiac network embedding the cells and the microbeads. The myocytes cell fraction pulled on ECM network and induced its compaction against the internal posts represented by the initial porous microbeads. This reciprocal interplay induced ECM consolidation without the use of external biophysical stimuli by leading to the formation of a beating and endogenous macrotissue. We have thus engineered a new class of cardiac micromodules and show its potential for the fabrication of endogenous cardiac tissue models useful for in vitro studies that involve the cardiac tissue remodeling.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 Acta Materialia Inc. Therapeutic over-expression of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) by transduced progenitors is a promising strategy to efficiently induce angiogenesis in ischemic tissues (e.g. limb muscle and myocardium), but tight control over the micro-environmental distribution of the dose is required to avoid induction of angioma-like tumors. Therapeutic VEGF release was achieved by purified transduced adipose mesenchymal stromal cells (ASC) that homogeneously produce specific VEGF levels, inducing only normal angiogenesis after injection in non-ischemic tissues. However, the therapeutic potential of this approach mostly in the cardiac field is limited by the poor cell survival and the restricted area of effect confined to the cell-injection site. The implantation of cells previously organized in vitro in 3D engineered tissues could overcome these issues. Here we hypothesized that collagen sponge-based construct (patch), generated by ASC expressing controlled VEGF levels, can function as delivery device to induce angiogenesis in surrounding areas (extrinsic vascularization). A 7-mm-thick acellular collagen scaffold (empty), sutured beneath the patch, provided a controlled and reproducible model to clearly investigate the ongoing angiogenesis in subcutaneous mice pockets. VEGF-expressing ASC significantly increased the capillary in-growth inside both the patch itself and the empty scaffold compared to naïve cells, leading to significantly improved survival of implanted cells. These data suggest that this strategy confers control (i) on angiogenesis efficacy and safety by means of ASC expressing therapeutic VEGF levels and (ii) over the treated area through the specific localization in an engineered collagen sponge-based patch. Statement of Significance Development of efficient pro-angiogenic therapies to restore the micro-vascularization in ischemic tissues is still an open issue. Although extensively investigated, the promising approach based on injections of progenitors transduced to over-express Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) has still several limitations: (i) need of a tight control over the microenvironmental VEGF dose to avoid angioma-like tumor growth; (ii) poor implanted cell survival; (iii) effect area restricted mainly to the injection sites. Here, we aimed to overcome these drawbacks by generating a novel cell-based controlled VEGF delivery device. In particular, transduced mesenchymal cells, purified to release a sustained, safe and efficient VEGF dose, were organized in three-dimensional engineered tissues to improve cell survival and provide a uniform vascularization throughout both the mm-thick implanted constructs themselves and the surrounding area.",

Mastering the interaction between cells and extracellular environment is a fundamental prerequisite in order to engineer functional biomaterial interfaces able to instruct cells with specific commands. Such advanced biomaterials might find relevant application in prosthesis design, tissue engineering, diagnostics and stem cell biology. Because of the highly complex, dynamic, and multifaceted context, a thorough understanding of the cell-material crosstalk has not been achieved yet; however, a variety of material features including biological cues, topography, and mechanical properties have been proved to impact the strength and the nature of the cell-material interaction, eventually affecting cell fate and functions. Although the nature of these three signals may appear very different, they are equated by their participation in the same material-cytoskeleton crosstalk pathway as they regulate cell adhesion events. In this work we present recent and relevant findings on the material-induced cell responses, with a particular emphasis on how the presentation of biochemical/biophysical signals modulates cell behavior. Finally, we summarize and discuss the literature data to draw out unifying elements concerning cell recognition of and reaction to signals displayed by material surfaces.",

Atomic force microscopy analysis allowed to optimize the procedure of nanoparticle cluster array fabrication in terms of electron beam dose and chemical protocol, enabling to achieve a good regularity in spacing and size (i.e. area and layer number) of the clusters. MicroRaman space resolved measurements were undertaken on large 2D arrays (100 × 100 μm2) made up of regularly microsized clusters. The high surface enhanced Raman signal measured on the structures highlights the full correspondence of the spatial and optical periodicity achieved.

Among them, Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells are the primary factories for the production of therapeutic proteins, including monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). To improve expression and stability, several methodologies have been adopted, including methods based on media formulation, selective pressure and cell- or vector engineering. This review presents current approaches aimed at improving mammalian cell factories that are based on the enhancement of translation. Among well-established techniques (codon optimization and improvement of mRNA secondary structure), we describe SINEUPs, a family of antisense long non-coding RNAs that are able to increase translation of partially overlapping protein-coding mRNAs. By exploiting their modular structure, SINEUP molecules can be designed to target virtually any mRNA of interest, and thus to increase the production of secreted proteins. Thus, synthetic SINEUPs represent a new versatile tool to improve the production of secreted proteins in biomanufacturing processes.",

The use of the proposed approach aims at improving the performances of bilateral teleoperation systems by reducing the human operator workload and increasing both the implementation and the execution efficiency. In fact, using our method virtual guidances do not need to be programmed a priori but they can be instead automatically generated and updated making the system suitable for unstructured environments. We strengthen the proposed method using passivity control in order to safely switch between different tasks while teleoperating under active constraints. A series of experiments emulating real industrial scenarios are used to show that the switch between multiple tasks can be passively and safely achieved and handled by the system.",

Different geometrical configurations have been used, ranging from spheres to rods and more complex star shapes, to modulate optical and ablating properties. In this work, multiple, ultra-small 6 nm AuNPs are encapsulated into larger spherical polymeric nanoconstructs (SPNs), made out of a poly(lactic acid-co-glycol acid) (PLGA) core stabilized by a superficial lipid-PEG monolayer. The optical and photothermal properties of the resulting nanoconstructs (Au-SPNs) are modulated by varying the initial loading input of AuNPs, ranging between 25 and 150 μg&lt;inf&gt;Au&lt;/inf&gt;. Au-SPNs exhibit a hydrodynamic diameter varying from ∼100 to 180 nm, growing with the gold content, and manifest up to 2-fold increase in thermal energy production per unit mass of gold for an initial input of 100 μg&lt;inf&gt;Au&lt;/inf&gt;. Au-SPNs are stable under physiological conditions up to 7 days and have direct cytotoxic effect on tumor cells. The superior photothermal performance of Au-SPNs is assessed in vitro on monolayers of breast cancer cells (SUM-159) and tumor spheroids of glioblastoma multiforme cells (U87-MG). The encapsulation of small AuNPs into larger spherical nanoconstructs enhances photothermal ablation and could favor tumor accumulation.",

Much of the work has focused on kernel selection criteria, particularly on minimizing a regularized error functional over a prescribed set of kernels. Empirical studies indicate that this approach can enhance statistical performance and is computationally feasible. In this paper, we present a theoretical analysis of its generalization error. We establish for a wide variety of classes of kernels, such as the set of all multivariate Gaussian kernels, that this learning method generalizes well and, when the regularization parameter is appropriately chosen, it is consistent. A central role in our analysis is played by the interaction between the sample error and the approximation error.",

To cope with the intrinsic noise sensitivity and ill-posedness of the problem, sparsity and non-negativity priors on the Acoustic Impulse Response (AIR) of the room can be exploited. Here we propose a novel iterative method, resulting in a sequence of convex problems relying on a weighted l1 constraint.

In this paper, we evaluate PMC toolsÂ -namely comics, mrmc and prismÂ -to investigate safe reinforcement learning in robots, i.e., to establish safety of policies learned considering feedback signals received upon acting in partially unknown environments. Introduced in previous contributions of ours, this application is a challenging domain wherein PMC tools act as back-engines of an automated methodology aimed to verify and repair control policies. We present an evaluation of the current state-of-the-art PMC tools to assess their potential on various case studies, including both real and simulated robots accomplishing navigation, manipulation and reaching tasks.",

This paper presents a novel teleoperation system with haptic feedback for the control of untethered soft grippers. The system is able to move and open/close the grippers by regulating the magnetic field and temperature in the workspace. Users can intuitively control the grippers using a grounded haptic interface, that is also capable of providing compelling force feedback information as the gripper interacts with the environment. The magnetic closed-loop control algorithm is designed starting from a Finite Element Model analysis. The electromagnetic model used is validated by a measurement of the magnetic field with a resolution of 0.1 mT and sampling rate of 6.8×106 samples/m2. The system shows an accuracy in positioning the gripper of 0.08 mm at a velocity of 0.81 mm/s. The robustness of the control and tracking algorithms are tested by spraying the workspace with water drops that cause glares and related disturbances of up to 0.41 mm.",

Direct Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS) is a powder-bed based Additive Manufacturing (AM) technique, which allows fully dense near net-shape parts to be obtained thanks to a powerful laser source able to melt and consolidate the powders layer by layer. Many types of metals are available for DMLS, and aluminium alloys play a major part in applications in different fields, from aerospace to automotive and robotics, due to their high strength-to-weight ratio. In previous years the DMLS technique has been refined with the final aim of producing complex shape components with these alloys. In this study the corrosion behaviour of an aluminium alloy processed through DMLS was studied using Potentiodynamic (PD) tests and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) tests. All the tests were executed on Al-10Si-Mg alloy in aerated diluted Harrison solution on surfaces obtained sectioning samples along different orientations with respect to the building direction. The effect of different surface finishing - shot peening and mechanical polishing - was also evaluated. The results highlighted preferential dissolution of α-Al at the border of the laser scan tracks and a slight variation with plane orientation. Moreover, the modification of the surface by shot peening or polishing increases pitting potential and reduces corrosion rate.",

As a major inspiration of biologically inspired systems, multi-legged robots have been developed due to their superior stability feature resulting from their large support polygon. The leg design of a majority of such robots is motivated by the skeleton of vertebrates such as dogs, or that of invertebrates such as spiders. Despite a wide variety of multi-pedal robots on the basis of the two aforesaid leg designs, a thorough comparison of the two underlying design principles remains to be done. This work addresses this problem and presents a comparative study for the two mammal-like and spider-like designs by looking at the joint torque profile, the responsive motion of the legs, and the thrust force applied by the robot. To this end, a set of performance indexes are defined based on the gravity compensation torque, the dynamic manipulability polytope and the force polytope, and evaluated in various leg configurations of the two designs.",

The present research work focuses on bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) thin films deposited on FTO-coated glass electrodes through the spin-coating technique, and discusses the influence of different film morphologies (dense and porous) on the physicochemical properties and photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance of the as-prepared photoanodes, for the water splitting reaction. The surface recombination phenomenon, which is one of the main issues of BiVO4, has been quantified by means of two distinct approaches: transient photocurrent measurements and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). This phenomenon has resulted to be higher in the porous material, thus a poorer performance has been observed than in the dense material. In order to increase the BiVO4 efficiency, a cobalt phosphate (CoPi) catalyst has been photo-electrodeposited onto the best BiVO4 electrode, employing an optimized technique and a photocurrent of up to 3 mA/cm2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE under neutral pH and 1 sun irradiation (100 mW/cm2) has been achieved. The charge transfer kinetics of the BiVO4 photoanodes, with and without CoPi, has also been quantified. The beneficial effect of this water oxidation catalyst, as well as the influence of the preparation method on the uniformity of the film and on its actual performance, is discussed in view of its prospective application in a real PEC device.",

During classical reaching studies the position of a salient target determines where the participant should reach, constraining the associated motor decisions. We aimed at investigating implicit variables guiding action selection when faced with the complexity of human-environment interaction. Subjects had to perform whole body reaching movements towards a uniform surface. We observed little variation in the self-chosen motor strategy across repeated trials while movements were variable across subjects being on a continuum from a pure knee flexion' associated with a downward center of mass (CoM) displacement to an ankle dorsi-flexion' associated with an upward CoM displacement. Two optimality criteria replicated these two strategies: a mix between mechanical energy expenditure and joint smoothness and a minimization of the amount of torques. Our results illustrate the presence of idiosyncratic values guiding posture and movement coordination that can be combined in a flexible manner as a function of context and subject. A first value accounts for the reach efficiency of the movement at the price of selecting possibly unstable postures. The other predicts stable dynamic equilibrium but requires larger energy expenditure and jerk.",

The photophysical signature of the tautomeric species of the asymmetric (N,N-dimethylanilino)-1,3-diketone molecule are investigated using approaches rooted in density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT). In particular, since this molecule, in the excited state, can undergo proton transfer reactions coupled to intramolecular charge transfer events, the different radiative and nonradiative channels are investigated by making use of different density-based indexes. The use of these tools, together with the analysis of both singlet and triplet potential energy surfaces, provide new insights into excited-state reactivity allowing one to rationalize the experimental findings including different behavior of the molecule as a function of solvent polarity.

However, their large exciton binding energy, which increases with decreasing thickness (number of layers), as well as the strong resonance peaks in the absorption spectra suggest that excitons are the primary photoexcited states. Detailed time-domain studies of the photoexcitation dynamics in TMDs exist mostly for MoS2. Here, we use femtosecond optical spectroscopy to study the exciton and charge dynamics following impulsive photoexcitation in few-layer WS2. We confirm excitons as the primary photoexcitation species and find that they dissociate into charge pairs with a time constant of about 1.3 ps. The better separation of the spectral features compared to MoS2 allows us to resolve a previously undetected process: these charges diffuse through the samples and get trapped at defects, such as flake edges or grain boundaries, causing an appreciable change of their transient absorption spectra. This finding opens the way to further studies of traps in TMD samples with different defect contents.",

Alpha-synuclein (αSyn) interferes with multiple steps of synaptic activity at pre-and post-synaptic terminals, however the mechanism/s by which αSyn alters neurotransmitter release and synaptic potentiation is unclear. By atomic force microscopy we show that human αSyn, when incubated with reconstituted membrane bilayer, induces lipid rafts' fragmentation. As a consequence, ion channels and receptors are displaced from lipid rafts with consequent changes in their activity. The enhanced calcium entry leads to acute mobilization of synaptic vesicles, and exhaustion of neurotransmission at later stages. At the post-synaptic terminal, an acute increase in glutamatergic transmission, with increased density of PSD-95 puncta, is followed by disruption of the interaction between N-methyl- d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) and PSD-95 with ensuing decrease of long term potentiation. While cholesterol loading prevents the acute effect of αSyn at the presynapse; inhibition of casein kinase 2, which appears activated by reduction of cholesterol, restores the correct localization and clustering of NMDARs.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 American Chemical Society. In this work, we investigate the optical and structural properties of the well-known triplet emitter bis(4′,6′-difluorophenylpyridinato)-iridium(III) picolinate (FIrpic), showing that its ability to pack in two different ordered crystal structures promotes attractive photophysical properties that are useful for solid-state lighting applications. This approach allows the detrimental effects of the nonradiative pathways on the luminescence performance in highly concentrated organic active materials to be weakened. The remarkable electro-optical behavior of sky-blue phosphorescent organic light-emitting diodes incorporating crystal domains of FIrpic, dispersed into an appropriate matrix as an active layer, has also been reported as well as the X-ray diffraction, nuclear magnetic resonance, electro-ionization mass spectrometry, and scanning electron microscopy analyses of the crystalline samples. We consider this result as a crucial starting point for further research aimed at the use of a crystal triplet emitter in optoelectronic devices to overcome the long-standing issue of luminescence self-quenching.",

The biocompatibility of polymers, lipids and surfactants used to formulate is crucial for the safe and sustainable development of nanocarriers (nanoparticles, liposomes, micelles, and other nanocarriers). In this study, Cholesterol (Chol), a typical biocompatible component of liposomal systems, was formulated in Chol-based solid nanoparticles (NPs) stabilized by the action of surfactant and without the help of any other formulative component. Parameters as type (Solutol HS 15, cholic acid sodium salt, poly vinyl alcohol and Pluronic-F68), concentration (0.2; 0.5 and 1% w/v) of surfactant and working temperature (r.t. and 45 °C) were optimized and all samples characterized in terms of size, zeta potential, composition, thermal behavior and structure. Results demonstrated that only Pluronic-F68 (0.5% w/v) favors the organization of Chol chains in structured NPs with mean diameter less than 400 nm. Moreover, we demonstrated the pivotal role of working temperature on surfactant aggregation state/architecture/stability of Chol-based nanoparticles. At room temperature, Pluronic-F68 exists in solution as individual coils. In this condition, nanoprecipitation of Chol formed the less stable NPs with a 14 ± 3% (w/w) of Pluronic-F68 prevalently on surface (NP-Chol/0.5). On the contrary, working near the critical micelle temperature (CMT) of surfactant (45 °C), Chol precipitates with Pluronic-F68 (9 ± 5% w/w) in a compact stable matricial structure (NP-Chol/0.5-45). In vitro studies highlight the low toxicity and the affinity of NP-Chol/0.5-45 for neuronal cells suggesting their potential applicability in pathologies with a demonstrated alteration of neuronal plasticity and synaptic communication (i.e. Huntington's disease).",

Both the cationic and neutral lithium–benzene systems (LiBz+ and LiBz) are considered as well as the sandwich compound (BzLiBz+). Among all the functionals, ωB97X emerges as the best approach for modeling all the three systems analyzed, while large deviations are observed for several functionals in the case of the problematic neutral Li–benzene system. Particular attention was devoted to the discussion of the results obtained with methods containing empirical dispersion corrections.

The XoSoft (www.xosoft.eu) project - funded under the European Union's Horizon 2020 framework programme - aims to develop a lower body soft exoskeleton to assist adults with mobility impairments. The XoSoft concept is being developed via an iterative user centered design process, with user requirements driving technical innovations. This paper describes a semistructured interview study undertaken in the initial stages of the project to determine Primary User (PU) and Secondary User (SU) requirements in relation to the function and design of the XoSoft concept. Fifteen PUs and 26 SUs were interviewed to explore their needs for mobility assistance, their experiences and requirements of mobility-related assistive devices, and their opinions on an initial portrayal of the XoSoft concept. Users provided valuable insights into their requirements in the following domains: desired functions and benefits of a device, practicability, training and support, design and aesthetics, and costs. Opinions of PUs and SUs of the XoSoft concept were largely positive, and a number of valuable design considerations were highlighted. The findings of this study will inform the design brief and technical specifications for XoSoft, and will assist the development of an alpha-prototype of the concept. Our results will also contribute to the evidence base available to all involved in the research and development of assistive devices for mobility, by giving voice to users and describing their needs/ wants in relation to such devices.",

However, the initiation and sequencing of voluntary actions also requires the contribution of mesial premotor regions, particularly the pre-supplementary motor area F6. We recorded 233 F6 neurons from 2 monkeys with chronic linear multishank neural probes during reaching-grasping visuomotor tasks. We showed that F6 neurons play a role in the control of forelimb movements and some of them (26%) exhibit visual and/or motor specificity for the target object. Interestingly, area F6 neurons form 2 functionally distinct populations, showing either visually-triggered or movement-related bursts of activity, in contrast to the sustained visual-to-motor activity displayed by ventral premotor area F5 neurons recorded in the same animals and with the same task during previous studies. These findings suggest that F6 plays a role in object grasping and extend existing models of the cortical grasping network.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland. Colloidal gold nanoparticles are a widespread nanomaterial with many potential applications, but their aggregation in suspension is a critical issue which is usually prevented by organic surfactants. This solution has some drawbacks, such as material contamination and modifications of its functional properties. The gold nanoparticles presented in this work have been synthesized by ultra-fast laser ablation in liquid, which addresses the above issues by overcoating the metal nanoparticles with an oxide layer. The main focus of the work is in the characterization of the oxidized gold nanoparticles, which were made first in solution by means of dynamic light scattering and optical spectroscopy, and then in dried form by transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and finally by surface potential measurements with atomic force microscopy. The light scattering assessed the nanoscale size of the formed particles and provided insight in their stability. The nanoparticles' size was confirmed by direct imaging in transmission electron microscopy, and their crystalline nature was disclosed by X-ray diffraction. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy showed measurements compatible with the presence of surface oxide, which was confirmed by the surface potential measurements, which are the novel point of the present work. In conclusion, the method of laser ablation in liquid for the synthesis of gold nanoparticles has been presented, and the advantage of this physical approach, consisting of coating the nanoparticles in situ with gold oxide which provides the required morphological and chemical stability without organic surfactants, has been confirmed by using scanning Kelvin probe microscopy for the first time.",

Anodization was carried out on ultra-thin films of aluminum on glass and/or silicon, followed by pore-opening. Gold (Au) was overcoated and micro-Raman/SERS measurements were carried out on test target analytes. Finite integration technique simulations of the APA-Au substrate were used both for the experimental design and simulations. It was observed that, under optimized conditions of APA and Au thickness, the SERS enhancement is higher than on standard APA-Au substrates based on thin (~100 nm) APA by up to a factor of ~20 for test molecules of mercaptobenzoic acid. The agreement between model and experimental results confirms the current understanding of SERS as being mainly due to the physical origin of plasmon resonances. The reported results represent one step towards micro-technological, integrated, disposable, high-sensitivity SERS chemical sensors and biosensors based on similar substrates.",

As a first relevant consequence, the specific absorption rate (SAR) of the initial core-shell nanocubes doubles after exposure to 25 cycles of alternating magnetic field stimulation. The improved SAR value was attributed to a gradual transformation of the Fe1-x O core to Fe3-δ O4 , as evidenced by structural analysis including high resolution electron microscopy and Rietveld analysis of X-ray diffraction patterns. The magnetically oxidized nanocubes, having large and coherent Fe3-δ O4 domains, reveal high saturation magnetization and behave superparamagnetically at room temperature. In comparison, the treatment of the same starting core-shell nanocubes by commonly used thermal annealing process renders a transformation to γ-Fe 2 O 3. In contrast to other thermal annealing processes, the method here presented has the advantage of promoting the oxidation at a macroscopic temperature below 37 °C. Using this soft oxidation process, we demonstrate that biotin-functionalized core-shell nanocubes can undergo a mild self-oxidation transformation without losing their functional molecular binding activity.",

Here we report a far-field transient absorption microscopy that does not require the sample to exhibit saturable absorption to break the diffraction barrier. By alternating the wavefront of the pump beams and exploiting a nonlinearity in the transient absorption intrinsic to semiconductors, we demonstrate imaging, beyond the diffraction limit, in CdSe nanobelts.

Such visual task usually rely on profusely textured objects: standard procedures such as detection of interest points or computation of appearance-based descriptors are favoured by using a highly informative surface. However, texture-less objects or their parts (i.e., those whose surface texture is poorly conditioned) are common in any environment but still challenging to deal with. This is due the fact that the distribution of surface brightness makes difficult to compute interest points or appearance-based descriptors. In this paper, we propose a method to estimate the 3D pose for texture-less objects given a coarse initialization: the pose is estimated using using edge correspondences, where the similarity measure is encoded using a pre-computed linear regression matrix. Furthermore, we also propose a method to increase the robustness of the estimated pose against background and object clutter. We validate both methods by using synthetic and real image sequences with objects with known ground truth.",

This paper presents an event-based approach to the detection of corner points, which benefits from the high temporal resolution, compressed visual information and low latency provided by an asynchronous neuromorphic event-based camera. The proposed method adapts the commonly used Harris corner detector to the event-based data, in which frames are replaced by a stream of asynchronous events produced in response to local light changes at μs temporal resolution. Responding only to changes in its field of view, an event-based camera naturally enhances edges in the scene, simplifying the detection of corner features. We characterised and tested the method on both a controlled pattern and a real scenario, using the dynamic vision sensor (DVS) on the neuromorphic iCub robot. The method detects corners with a typical error distribution within 2 pixels. The error is constant for different motion velocities and directions, indicating a consistent detection across the scene and over time. We achieve a detection rate proportional to speed, higher than frame-based technique for a significant amount of motion in the scene, while also reducing the computational cost.",

The success of distributed power generation by plants based on solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) is hindered by reliability problems that can be mitigated through an effective fault detection and isolation (FDI) system. However, the numerous operating conditions under which such plants can operate and the random size of the possible faults make identifying damaged plant components starting from the physical variables measured in the plant very difficult. In this context, we assess two classical FDI strategies (model-based with fault signature matrix and data-driven with statistical classification) and the combination of them. For this assessment, a quantitative model of the SOFC-based plant, which is able to simulate regular and faulty conditions, is used. Moreover, a hybrid approach based on the random forest (RF) classification method is introduced to address the discrimination of regular and faulty situations due to its practical advantages. Working with a common dataset, the FDI performances obtained using the aforementioned strategies, with different sets of monitored variables, are observed and compared. We conclude that the hybrid FDI strategy, realized by combining a model-based scheme with a statistical classifier, outperforms the other strategies. In addition, the inclusion of two physical variables that should be measured inside the SOFCs can significantly improve the FDI performance, despite the actual difficulty in performing such measurements.",

We present a simple method and its experimental implementation to determine the pulse durations and linear chirps of the pump-and-probe pulse and the Stokes pulse in a coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering microscope at sample level without additional autocorrelators. Our approach exploits the delay line, ubiquitous in such microscopes, to perform a convolution of the pump-and-probe and Stokes pulses as a function of their relative delay and it is based on the detection of the photons emitted from an appropriate non-linear sample. The analysis of the non-resonant four-wave-mixing and sum-frequency-generation signals allows for the direct retrieval of the pulse duration on the sample and the linear chirp of each pulse. This knowledge is crucial in maximizing the spectral-resolution and contrast in CARS imaging.Copyright:",

KGaA, WeinheimSolution-processed few-layer MoS2 flakes are exploited as an active buffer layer in hybrid lead–halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Glass/FTO/compact-TiO2/mesoporous-TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/MoS2/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au solar cells are realized with the MoS2 flakes having a twofold function, acting both as a protective layer, by preventing the formation of shunt contacts between the perovskite and the Au electrode, and as a hole transport layer from the perovskite to the Spiro-OMeTAD. As prepared PSC demonstrates a power conversion efficiency (η) of 13.3%, along with a higher lifetime stability over 550 h with respect to reference PSC without MoS2 (Δη/η = −7% vs. Δη/η = −34%). Large-area PSCs (1.05 cm2 active area) are also fabricated to demonstrate the scalability of this approach, achieving η of 11.5%.

The existence of an aqueous and a non-aqueous phase allows water-soluble molecules to be introduced without altering the structure and the degradation of the fibers, and means that their release properties under physiological conditions can be controlled. To demonstrate the loading capability and flexibility of the blend, various species were introduced, from magnetic nanoparticles and quantum rods to biological molecules.

The functional consequence of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) release at mossy fiber terminals is still a debated topic. Here, we provide multiple evidence of GABA release in cultured autaptic hippocampal granule cells. In ∼50% of the excitatory autaptic neurons, GABA, VGAT, or GAD67 colocalized with vesicular glutamate transporter 1-positive puncta, where both GABAB and GABAA receptors (Rs) were present. Patch-clamp recordings showed a clear enhancement of autaptic excitatory postsynaptic currents in response to the application of the GABABR antagonist CGP58845 only in neurons positive to the selective granule cell marker Prox1, and expressing low levels of GAD67. Indeed, GCP non-responsive excitatory autaptic neurons were both Prox1-and GAD67-negative. Although the amount of released GABA was not sufficient to activate functional postsynaptic GABAARs, it effectively activated presynaptic GABABRs that maintain a tonic \"brake\" on the probability of release and on the size of the readily releasable pool and contributed to resting potential hyperpolarization possibly through extrasynaptic GABAAR activation. The autocrine inhibition exerted by GABABRs on glutamate release enhanced both paired-pulse facilitation and post-tetanic potentiation. Such GABABR-mediated changes in short-term plasticity confer to immature granule cells the capability to modulate their filtering properties in an activity-dependent fashion, with remarkable consequences on the dynamic behavior of neural circuits.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 IEEE.Fingertip contact forces are of utmost importance in evaluating the quality of the human grasp. However, measuring such forces during object manipulation is not a trivial task. In this paper, we propose a novel method to estimate the fingertip contact forces in grasping deformable objects with known shape and stiffness matrix. The proposed approach uses a sensing glove instrumented with inertial and magnetic sensors. Data obtained from the accelerometers and gyroscopes placed on the distal phalanges are used to determine when the fingers establish contacts with the object. The sensing glove is used to estimate the configuration of the hand and the deformation of the object at each contact with the fingertips of the human hand. The force exerted by each fingertip is obtained by multiplying the stiffness matrix of the object and the vector of object's local deformation in the contact point. Extensive simulations have been performed in order to evaluate the robustness of the proposed approach to noisy measurements, and uncertainties in human hand model. In order to validate the proposed approach, experimental validations with a virtual object have been performed. A haptic device was used to generate the contact forces with the virtual object and accurately measure the forces exerted by the users during the interaction.",

The results show not only the indentation forces values increase depending on the indentation velocity increment, but also they decrease depending on the number of cycles. While the fingertip recovery depends on the time, but not on the indentation velocity.

            "abstract": "© 2016 Associazione Italiana di Fisica Medica Purpose A radio-guided surgery technique with β-emitting radio-tracers was suggested to overcome the effect of the large penetration of γ radiation. The feasibility studies in the case of brain tumors and abdominal neuro-endocrine tumors were based on simulations starting from PET images with several underlying assumptions. This paper reports, as proof-of-principle of this technique, an ex vivo test on a meningioma patient. This test allowed to validate the whole chain, from the evaluation of the SUV of the tumor, to the assumptions on the bio-distribution and the signal detection. Methods A patient affected by meningioma was administered 300 MBq of 90Y-DOTATOC. Several samples extracted from the meningioma and the nearby Dura Mater were analyzed with a β− probe designed specifically for this radio-guided surgery technique. The observed signals were compared both with the evaluation from the histology and with the Monte Carlo simulation. Results we obtained a large signal on the bulk tumor (105 cps) and a significant signal on residuals of ∼0.2 ml (28 cps). We also show that simulations predict correctly the observed yields and this allows us to estimate that the healthy tissues would return negligible signals (≈1 cps). This test also demonstrated that the exposure of the medical staff is negligible and that among the biological wastes only urine has a significant activity. Conclusions This proof-of-principle test on a patient assessed that the technique is feasible with negligible background to medical personnel and confirmed that the expectations obtained with Monte Carlo simulations starting from diagnostic PET images are correct.",

Organohalide perovskites have emerged as a class of materials with a unique combination of optoelectronic properties, suitable for a plethora of applications ranging from solar cells to photoelectrochemical tandem cells, to lasing and lighting. Theoretical and computational modeling can deliver an hitherto inaccessible atomistic view of the crucial material properties and heterointerfaces ruling the operational mechanisms in all these devices. Here we present a unified view of recent activity in the computational modeling of interfaces relevant to perovskites solar cells. The performance of the proposed simulation toolbox along with the fundamental modeling strategies are illustrated using selected examples of relevant materials and representative interfaces. In particular, we discuss interfaces between the prototype methylammonium lead iodide perovskite with TiO2 and ZnO semiconductors (acting as electron selective contacts in solar cells), exploring different surface terminations and doping by chloride ions. Also the effect of defects at the interface with TiO2 is analyzed and their impact on solar cell performance is discussed. Finally, the heterogeneous interface between methylammonium lead iodide and water is analyzed, revealing dynamical hints on the perovskite degradation by water.",

            "abstract": "© Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.In this chapter, we address fish behavior analysis in unconstrained underwater videos. Assessing this is based on unusual fish trajectory detection which tries to detect rare fish behaviors, which can help marine biologists to detect new behaviors and to detect environmental changes observed from the unusual trajectories of fish. Fish trajectories are classified as normal and unusual which are the common behaviors of fish and the behaviors that are rare respectively. We investigated three different classification methods to detect unusual fish trajectories. The first method is a filtering method to eliminate normal trajectories, the second method is based on labeled and clustered data and the third method constructs a hierarchy using clustered and labeled data based on data similarity. The first two methods can be seen as preliminary works while the results of them are significant considering the challenges of underwater environments and highly imbalanced trajectory data that we used. In this chapter, we briefly summarize these two methods and mainly focus on the third method (hierarchial decomposition) which presented improved results and performed better than the state of art methods.",

            "abstract": "© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016. We proposed and demonstrated the first account of large-area, semi-transparent, tandem photosensitive nanocrystal skins (PNSs) constructed on flexible substrates operating on the principle of photogenerated potential buildup, which avoid the need for applying an external bias and circumvent the current-matching limitation between junctions. We successfully fabricated and operated the tandem PNSs composed of single monolayers of colloidal water-soluble CdTe and CdHgTe nanocrystals (NCs) in adjacent junctions on a Kapton polymer tape. Owing to the usage of a single NC layer in each junction, noise generation was significantly reduced while keeping the resulting PNS films considerably transparent. In each junction, photogenerated excitons are dissociated at the interface of the semi-transparent Al electrode and the NC layer, with holes migrating to the contact electrode and electrons trapped in the NCs. As a result, the tandem PNSs lead to an open-circuit photovoltage buildup equal to the sum of those of the two single junctions, exhibiting a total voltage buildup of 128.4 mV at an excitation intensity of 75.8 μW cm-2 at 350 nm. Furthermore, we showed that these flexible PNSs could be bent over 3.5 mm radius of curvature and cut out in arbitrary shapes without damaging the operation of individual parts and without introducing any significant loss in the total sensitivity. These findings indicate that the NC skins are promising as building blocks to make low-cost, flexible, large-area UV/visible sensing platforms with highly efficient full-spectrum conversion.",

A cascade of two common source amplifiers, engineered to provide enhanced output, composes the schematic. The tactile sensor has been designed adopting an extended gate configuration to provide higher robustness to the mechanical solicitations. The optimization of the piezoelectric properties of the device has been accomplished through a well-established poling procedure, reaching piezoelectric coefficient of 45 pC/N. Once fabricated, the sensor has been detached from the rigid carrier and bonded to a flexible PCB for testing purpose. A mini-shaker has been used to electromechanically stimulate the sensor and verify the performance, obtaining output signal up to 2.5Vp-p for a mechanical stimulus of 1N@200Hz.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 IEEE.The design and control of robotic systems capable of performing dynamic tasks, such as those involving stable impact, is of growing interest within the robotic community. If their structure is conceived as rigid, it results in massive and bulky systems, so that high forces are generated in the interaction with the external environment. At the opposite, if the robotic structure is designed as flexible, the interaction with the external environment produces lower forces thanks to their weight reduction and to the energy absorption guaranteed by the structural deformations. However, adding flexibility leads to unwanted vibrations which is a major drawback, that must be taken into account by the control algorithm to prevent resonance phenomena and to guarantee precise task performance. In this paper, the authors propose a structural model of a flexible robotic arm to be implemented in a model based control algorithm. The study is based on the screw theory approach which allows for an easy-to-manipulate concise symbolic representation for both kinematics and dynamics.",

Load dependent deflections deteriorate the precision of the mechanism, while oscillations prolong settling times. Commonly, the engineer seeks to minimize the degree of elasticity through the selection of materials and structure design. This paper looks at the link elasticity from a different perspective. It proposes a six step control approach to actively damp oscillations, compensate for static deflections and finally exploit the elasticity for contact force sensing and physical interaction control. This path from elasticity being a functional mechanism flaw to link compliance offering new potentials for force control is exemplified based on multi-link experimental setup.",

The novel optical property of this special WS2 monolayer is facilitated by chemical heterogeneity. The photoluminescence of the bright band is dominated by emissions from trion and biexciton while the emission from defect-bound exciton dominates the photoluminescence at the dark band.

Here we report a single cell screening approach based on Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) microimaging. We fabricated a SERS-labelled nanovector based on the biofunctionalization of gold nanoparticles with folic acid. After treating the cells with the nanovector, we were able to distinguish three different cell populations from different cell lines (cancer HeLa and PC-3, and normal HaCaT lines), suitably chosen for their different expressions of folate binding proteins. The nanovector, indeed, binds much more efficiently on cancer cell lines than on normal ones, resulting in a higher SERS signal measured on cancer cells.

These maps indicate that the human somatosensory system devoted to the hand encompasses a widespread network covering more than 10% of the cortical surface of both hemispheres. This network includes phasic components, centered on primary somatosensory cortex and neighboring motor, premotor, and inferior parietal regions, and tonic components, centered on opercular and insular areas, and involving human parietal rostroventral area and ventral medial-superior-temporal area.

Self-assembly of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) can be used for several applications including sensors, lab on chips, and surface enhanced Raman scattering sensitive substrates. The architecture of the AuNPs aggregates is driven by the nanoparticle size, surface charge, and dielectric constant, and by the surface functionality of the substrate, which determine the mutual interaction forces among the AuNPs. These forces were indirectly investigated by means of fractal analysis of the resulting patterns of aggregates. We drop-cast AuNPs dispersions with five different values of concentration onto glass substrates, which resulted in self-assembled thin films with different aggregation density. We imaged the AuNPs aggregates with scanning electron microscope and studied their topological properties. We observed an increase in the fractal dimension of the aggregates with the AuNPs concentration, reaching a fractal dimension value of 1.56 ± 0.01 for the low-density samples and 1.88 ± 0.01 for the high-density samples. Concurrently, the photoluminescence peak showed only a weak red-shift with increasing concentration, while the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy showed higher binding energy than in the bulk gold, due to the different structural arrangement of the AuNPs. Thus, a correlation was established between the fractal dimension and the inter-particle interaction forces that control the aggregation.",

            "abstract": "© 2015 Elsevier Inc. Chronic stress is one of the most relevant triggering factors for major depression. Microglial cells are highly sensitive to stress and, more generally, to environmental challenges. However, the role of these brain immune cells in mediating the effects of stress is still unclear. Fractalkine signaling – which comprises the chemokine CX3CL1, mainly expressed by neurons, and its receptor CX3CR1, almost exclusively present on microglia in the healthy brain – has been reported to critically regulate microglial activity. Here, we investigated whether interfering with microglial function by deleting the Cx3cr1 gene affects the brain's response to chronic stress. To this purpose, we housed Cx3cr1 knockout and wild-type adult mice in either control or stressful environments for 2 weeks, and investigated the consequences on microglial phenotype and interactions with synapses, synaptic transmission, behavioral response and corticosterone levels. Our results show that hampering neuron–microglia communication via the CX3CR1–CX3CL1 pathway prevents the effects of chronic unpredictable stress on microglial function, short- and long-term neuronal plasticity and depressive-like behavior. Overall, the present findings suggest that microglia-regulated mechanisms may underlie the differential susceptibility to stress and consequently the vulnerability to diseases triggered by the experience of stressful events, such as major depression.",

Accurate morphological and optical characterization of nanocomposite foils is provided as a function of nanorod size and content, and their color conversion properties are investigated in combination with a blue-emitting LED source. This approach combines the tunable optical features of inorganic quantum-confined light emitters with the facile processability of the polymeric host and offers a highly versatile design tool, which can be exploited in a wide spectrum of lighting and photonic devices. The preparation procedure reported here is even compatible with the implementation of an engineered array of microlens on the front-end surface of the nanocomposite foil and thus makes possible a tailored control of the color-converted photometric pattern.",

However, despite the presence of many devices, user acceptance is low. Not only are visually impaired adults not using these devices but they are also too complex for children. The majority of these devices have been developed without considering either the brain mechanisms underlying the deficit or the natural ability of the brain to process information. Most of them use complex feedback systems and overwhelm sensory, attentional and memory capacities. Here we review the neuroscientific studies on orientation and mobility in visually impaired adults and children and present the technological devices developed so far to improve locomotion skills. We also discuss how we think these solutions could be improved. We hope that this paper may be of interest to neuroscientists and technologists and it will provide a common background to develop new science-driven technology, more accepted by visually impaired adults and suitable for children with visual disabilities.",

Cognitive deficits represent a major burden of neuropsychiatric disorders and result in part from abnormal communication within hippocampal-prefrontal circuits. While it has been hypothesized that this network dysfunction arises during development, long before the first clinical symptoms, experimental evidence is still missing. Here, we show that pre-juvenile mice mimicking genetic and environmental risk factors of disease (dual-hit GE mice) have poorer recognition memory that correlates with augmented coupling by synchrony and stronger directed interactions between prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. The network dysfunction emerges already during neonatal development, yet it initially consists in a diminished hippocampal theta drive and consequently, a weaker and disorganized entrainment of local prefrontal circuits in discontinuous oscillatory activity in dual-hit GE mice when compared with controls. Thus, impaired maturation of functional communication within hippocampal-prefrontal networks switching from hypo- to hyper-coupling may represent a mechanism underlying the pathophysiology of cognitive deficits in neuropsychiatric disorders.",

However, in vitro vascular microcapillaries - as well as plug production and microparticle alignment - require mainly circular microchannels that can be used also in applications based on open microchannels. Nowadays, a simple, low cost, and versatile method to fabricate circular microchannels is still missing. Here, we report on a fast, inexpensive, flexible and reproducible method to fabricate circular microchannels by coupling spin coating with micromilled square microchannels. The proposed method is based on the balance between the displacement of liquid PDMS induced by centrifugal forces and the surface tension that tends to keep the liquid accumulated especially in the corners, which become therefore rounded. To show the versatility of the described experimental study we prepared a variety of rounded microchannels, including branched and PMMA-PDMS hybrid configuration microchannels. Finally, an endothelial cell layer was formed by culturing brain endothelial bEnd.3 cells inside the proposed circular microchannels. Results demonstrated a more successful adhesion, growth, and homogeneous distribution of the cells along the circular microchannel than those observed in the square microchannel used as a control.",

This material is used for the fabrication of flexible conductive films prepared via simple drop-casting of the NS dispersions without any additional treatment. The electrical performance of these coatings is benchmarked against copper selenide spherical nanocrystals (SNCs) in order to demonstrate the advantage of 2D morphology of the NSs for flexible electronics. In this contest, Cu2−xSe SNC films exhibit higher conductivity but lower reproducibility due to the formation of cracks leading to discontinuous films. Furthermore, the electrical properties of the films deposited on different flexible substrates following their bending, stretching and folding are studied. A comparison of Cu2−xSe SNC and CuSe NS films reveals an increased stability of the CuSe NS films under mechanical stress applied to the samples and their improved long-term stability in air.",

In the biomedical sector the availability of engineered scaffolds and dressings that control and reduce inflammatory states is highly desired, particularly for the management of burn wounds. In this work, we demonstrate for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, that electrospun fibrous dressings of poly(octyl cyanoacrylate) (POCA) combined with polypropylene fumarate (PPF) possess anti-inflammatory activity and promote the fast and effective healing of mild skin burns in an animal model. The fibers produced had an average diameter of (0.8 F 0.1) m and they were able to provide a conformal coverage of the injured tissue. The application of the fibrous mats on the burned tissue effectively reduced around 80% of the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the first 48 h in comparison with un-treated animals, and enhanced skin epithelialization. From histological analysis, the skin thickness of the animals treated with POCA : PPF dressings appeared similar to that of one of the naïve animals: (13.7 F 1.4) m and (14.3 F 2.5) m for naïve and treated animals, respectively. The density of dermal cells was comparable as well: (1100 F 112) cells mm-2 and (1358 F 255) cells mm-2 for naïve and treated mice, respectively. The results demonstrate the suitability of the electrospun dressings in accelerating and effectively promoting the burn healing process.",

This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.The common fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster (Dm) is a simple animal species that contributed significantly to the development of neurobiology whose leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 mutants (LRRK2) loss-of-function in the WD40 domain represent a very interesting tool to look into physiopathology of Parkinson's disease (PD). Accordingly, LRRK2 Dm have also the potential to contribute to reveal innovative therapeutic approaches to its treatment. Withania somnifera Dunal, a plant that grows spontaneously also in Mediterranean regions, is known in folk medicine for its anti-inflammatory and protective properties against neurodegeneration. The aim of this study was to evaluate the neuroprotective effects of its standardized root methanolic extract (Wse) on the LRRK2 loss-of-function Dm model of PD. To this end mutant and wild type (WT) flies were administered Wse, through diet, at different concentrations as larvae and adults (L+/A+) or as adults (L-/A+) only. LRRK2 mutants have a significantly reduced lifespan and compromised motor function and mitochondrial morphology compared toWT flies 1% Wse-enriched diet, administered to Dm LRRK2 as L-/A+and improved a) locomotor activity b) muscle electrophysiological response to stimuli and also c) protected against mitochondria degeneration. In contrast, the administration of Wse to Dm LRRK2 as L+/A+, no matter at which concentration, worsened lifespan and determined the appearance of increased endosomal activity in the thoracic ganglia. These results, while confirming that the LRRK2 loss-of-function in the WD40 domain represents a valid model of PD, reveal that under appropriate concentrations Wse can be usefully employed to counteract some deficits associated with the disease. However, a careful assessment of the risks, likely related to the impaired endosomal activity, is required.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 by the authors. The separation of oil from water in emulsions is a great environmental challenge, since oily wastewater is industrially produced. Here, we demonstrate a highly efficient method to separate oil from water in non-stabilized emulsions, using functionalized cellulose fiber networks. This is achieved by the modification of the wetting properties of the fibers, transforming them from oil- and water-absorbing to water-absorbing and oil-proof. In particular, two diverse layers of polymeric coatings, paraffin wax and poly(dimethylsiloxane)-b-poly(ethylene oxide) (PDMS-b-PEO) diblock copolymer, are applied on the surface of each individual fiber by a two-step dip adsorption process. The resulting cellulose networks exhibit superhydrophilicity and underwater superoleophobicity and they are mechanically reinforced. Therefore, the described treatment makes cellulose fiber networks excellent candidates for the filtration and subsequent removal of oil from oil-in-water non-stabilized emulsions with oil separation efficiency up to 99%. The good selectivity, reproducibility, and cost effectiveness of the preparation process leads to the production of low cost filters that can be used in oil-water separation applications.",

We analysed, for the first time, the expression and catalytic activities of the ecto- and mitochondrial ATP synthase during liver regeneration. Liver regeneration was induced in rats by two-thirds partial hepatectomy. The protein level and the ATP synthase and/or hydrolase activities of the hepatocyte ecto- and mitochondrial ATP synthase were analysed on freshly isolated hepatocytes and mitochondria from control, sham-operated and partial hepatectomized rats. During the priming phase of liver regeneration, 3 h after partial hepatectomy, liver mitochondria showed a marked lowering of the ATP synthase protein level that was reflected in the impairment of both ATP synthesis and hydrolysis. The ecto-ATP synthase level, in 3 h partial hepatectomized hepatocytes, was decreased similarly to the level of the mitochondrial ATP synthase, associated with a lowering of the ecto-ATP hydrolase activity coupled to proton influx. Noteworthily, the ecto-ATP synthase activity coupled to proton efflux was completely inhibited in 3 h partial hepatectomized hepatocytes, even in the presence of a marked intracellular acidification that would sustain it as in control and sham-operated hepatocytes. At the end of the liver regeneration, 7 days after partial hepatectomy, the level and the catalytic activities of the ecto- and mitochondrial ATP synthase reached the control and sham-operated values. The specific modulation of hepatocyte ecto-ATP synthase catalytic activities during liver regeneration priming phase may modulate the extracellular ADP/ATP levels and/or proton influx/efflux trafficking, making hepatocyte ecto-ATP synthase a candidate for a novel player in the liver regeneration process.",

The spatial resolution of a stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscope is theoretically unlimited and practically determined by the signal-to-noise ratio. Typically, an increase of the STED beam's power leads to an improvement of the effective resolution. However, this improvement may vanish because an increased STED beam's power is often accompanied by an increased photobleaching, which worsen the effective resolution by reducing the signal strength. A way to lower the photobleaching in pulsed STED (P-STED) implementations is to reduce the peak intensity lengthening the pulses duration (for a given average STED beam's power). This also leads to a reduction of the fluorophores quenching, thus a reduction of the effective resolution, but the time-gated detection was proved to be successful in recovering these reductions. Here we demonstrated that a subnanosecond fiber laser beam (pulse width ∼600 ps) reduces the photobleaching with respect to a traditional stretched hundreds picosecond (∼200 ps) beam provided by a Ti:Sapphire laser, without any effective spatial resolution lost.",

Tumour necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS) is a multisystemic autoinflammatory condition associated with heterozygous TNFRSF1A mutations, presenting with a variety of clinical symptoms, many of which yet unexplained. In this work, we aimed at deepening into TRAPS pathogenic mechanisms sustained by monocytes. Methods. Microarray experiments were conducted to identify genes whose expression results altered in patients compared to healthy individuals, both under basal condition and following LPS stimulation. Results. An inflammatory state baseline, characterised by constitutive overexpression of IL1β and IL1R1 receptor, has been shown in TRAPS patients compared to controls, including in non-active disease phases. Following LPS stimulation, IL1RN up-regulation is stronger in controls than in patients and inflammatory pathways and microRNAs undergo differential regulation. Genes involved in post-translational modifications, protein folding and ubiquitination result constitutively up-regulated in TRAPS, while response to interferon types I and II is defective, failing to be up-regulated by LPS. TGFβ pathway is down-regulated in untreated TRAPS monocytes, while genes involved in redox regulation result constitutively over-expressed. Finally, additional molecular alterations seem to reflect organ failures sometime complicating the disease. Conclusion. Gene expression profile in resting TRAPS monocytes has confirmed the patients' chronic inflammatory condition. In addition, pathways not yet associated with the disease have been disclosed, such as interferon types I and II response to LPS stimulation and a downregulation of the TGFβ pathway in basal condition. The role of miRNA, suggested by our results, deserves indepth analyses in light of the possible development of targeted therapies.",

In this context, the results achieved in neurotoxicology and biomedical research practices using neural networks obtained from mouse or rat primary culture of neurons would benefit of the parallel evaluation of the same parameters using fully differentiated neurons with a human genetic background, thus emphasizing the current need of neuronal cells with human origin. In this work, we developed a human functionally active neural network derived by human neuroblastoma cancer cells genetically engineered to overexpress NDM29, a non-coding RNA whose increased synthesis causes the differentiation toward a neuronal phenotype. These cells are here analyzed accurately showing functional and morphological traits of neurons such as the expression of neuron-specific proteins and the possibility to generate the expected neuronal current traces and action potentials. Their morphometrical analysis is carried out by quantitative phase microscopy showing soma and axon sizes compatible with those of functional neurons. The ability of these cells to connect autonomously forming physical junctions recapitulates that of hippocampal neurons, as resulting by connect-ability test. Lastly, these cells self-organize in neural networks able to produce spontaneous firing, in which spikes can be clustered in bursts. Altogether, these results show that the neural network obtained by NDM29-dependent differentiation of neuroblastoma cells is a suitable tool for biomedical research practices.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 Elsevier Ltd. Epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV) is a distinct species within the genus Orbivirus, within the family Reoviridae. The epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus genome comprises ten segments of linear, double stranded (ds) RNA, which are packaged within each virus particle. The EHDV virion has a three layered capsid-structure, generated by four major viral proteins: VP2 and VP5 (outer capsid layer); VP7 (intermediate, core-surface layer) and VP3 (innermost, sub-core layer). Although EHDV infects cattle sporadically, several outbreaks have recently occurred in this species in five Mediterranean countries, indicating a potential threat to the European cattle industry. EHDV is transmitted by biting midges of the genus Culicoides, which can travel long distances through wind-born movements (particularly over water), increasing the potential for viral spread in new areas/countries. Expression systems to generate self-assembled virus like particles (VLPs) by simultaneous expression of the major capsid-proteins, have been established for several viruses (including bluetongue virus). This study has developed expression systems for production of EHDV VLPs, for use as non-infectious antigens in both vaccinology and serology studies, avoiding the risk of genetic reassortment between vaccine and field strains and facilitating large scale antigen production. Genes encoding the four major-capsid proteins of a field strain of EHDV-6, were isolated and cloned into transfer vectors, to generate two recombinant baculoviruses. The expression of these viral genes was assessed in insect cells by monitoring the presence of specific viral mRNAs and by western blotting. Electron microscopy studies confirmed the formation and purification of assembled VLPs.",

However, the functional significance of Arc in schizophrenia-related neurobehavioral phenotypes and brain circuits is unclear. Here, we find that, consistent with schizophrenia-related phenotypes, disruption of Arc in mice produces deficits in sensorimotor gating, cognitive functions, social behaviors, and amphetamine-induced psychomotor responses. Furthermore, genetic disruption of Arc leads to concomitant hypoactive mesocortical and hyperactive mesostriatal dopamine pathways. Application of a D1 agonist to the prefrontal cortex or a D2 antagonist in the ventral striatum rescues Arc-dependent cognitive or psychomotor abnormalities, respectively. Our findings demonstrate a role for Arc in the regulation of dopaminergic neurotransmission and related behaviors. The results also provide initial biological support implicating Arc in dopaminergic and behavioral abnormalities related to schizophrenia.",

Respiratory complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) is a ubiquitous bioenergetic enzyme formed by over 40 subunits in eukaryotes and aminimum of 11 subunits in bacteria. Recently, crystal structures have greatly advanced our knowledge of complex I but have not clarified the details of its reaction withubiquinone (Q). This reaction is essential for bioenergyproduction andtakes place in a large cavityembedded within a conservedmodule that is homologous to the catalytic core of Ni-Fe hydrogenases. However,how a hydrogenase core has evolved into the protonmotive Q reductase module of complex I has remained unclear. This work has exploited the abundant genomic information that is currently available to deduce structure-function relationships in complex I that indicate the evolutionary steps of Q reactivity and its adaptation to naturalQ substrates. The results provide answers to fundamental questions regarding various aspects of complex I reaction with Q and help re-defining the old concept that this reaction may involve twoQor inhibitor sites.

            "abstract": "© 2016 Céol et al. Background: Biologists generally interrogate genomics data using web-based genome browsers that have limited analytical potential. New generation genome browsers such as the Integrated Genome Browser (IGB) have largely overcome this limitation and permit customized analyses to be implemented using plugins. We illustrate the use of a plugin for IGB that exploits advanced visualization techniques to integrate the analysis of genomics data with network and structural approaches. Results: We show how visualization technologies that combine both genomics and network biology can facilitate the selection of the key amino acid contacts from protein-protein and protein-drug interactions. Starting from the MDM2-P53 interaction, which is a high-value target for cancer therapy, and Nutlin, the parent small molecule of an MDM2 antagonist that is currently in clinical trials, we show that this method can be generalized to analyze how drugs and mutations can interfere with both protein-protein and drug-protein networks. We illustrate this point by two additional use-cases exploring the molecular basis of tamoxifen side effects and of drug resistance in chronic myeloid leukemia patients. Conclusions: Combined network and structure biology approaches provide key insights into both the genetic and the edgetic roles of variants in diseases. 3D interactomes facilitate the identification of disease-relevant interactions that can then be specifically targeted by drugs. Recent advances in molecular interaction and structure visualization tools have greatly simplified the mapping of mutated residues to molecular interaction interfaces. Such approaches can now also be integrated with genome visualization tools to enable comparative analyses of interaction contacts.",

However the latter are inferred from net fluxes, and we argue that this approximation is not valid for enzymes working nearby thermodynamic equilibrium.

            "abstract": "PEDOT:PSS is a conductive polymer that can be integrated into last generation Organic Electrochemical Transistor (OECT) devices for biological inspection, identification and analysis. While a variety of reports in literature demonstrated the chemical and biological sensitivity of these devices, still their ability in resolving complex mixtures remains controversial. Similar OECT devices display good time dynamics behavior but lack spatial resolution. In this work, we integrated PEDOT:PSS with patterns of super-hydrophobic pillars in which a finite number of those pillars is independently controlled for site-selective measurement of a solution. We obtained a multifunctional, hierarchical OECT device that bridges the micro- to the nano-scales for specific, combined time and space resolved analysis of the sample. Due to super-hydrophobic surface properties, the biological species in the drop are driven by convection, diffusion, and the externally applied electric field: the balance/unbalance between these forces will cause the molecules to be transported differently within its volume depending on particle size thus realizing a size-selective separation. Within this framework, the separation and identification of two different molecules, namely Cetyl Trimethyl Ammonium Bromid (CTAB) and adrenaline, in a biological mixture have been demonstrated, showing that geometrical control at the micro-nano scale impart unprecedented selectivity to the devices.",

            "abstract": "© 2016, The Author(s). Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is a neuromuscular disease caused by the expansion of a polyglutamine tract in the androgen receptor (AR). The mechanism by which expansion of polyglutamine in AR causes muscle atrophy is unknown. Here, we investigated pathological pathways underlying muscle atrophy in SBMA knock-in mice and patients. We show that glycolytic muscles were more severely affected than oxidative muscles in SBMA knock-in mice. Muscle atrophy was associated with early-onset, progressive glycolytic-to-oxidative fiber-type switch. Whole genome microarray and untargeted lipidomic analyses revealed enhanced lipid metabolism and impaired glycolysis selectively in muscle. These metabolic changes occurred before denervation and were associated with a concurrent enhancement of mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, which induced peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1 alpha (PGC1α) expression. At later stages of disease, we detected mitochondrial membrane depolarization, enhanced transcription factor EB (TFEB) expression and autophagy, and mTOR-induced protein synthesis. Several of these abnormalities were detected in the muscle of SBMA patients. Feeding knock-in mice a high-fat diet (HFD) restored mTOR activation, decreased the expression of PGC1α, TFEB, and genes involved in oxidative metabolism, reduced mitochondrial abnormalities, ameliorated muscle pathology, and extended survival. These findings show early-onset and intrinsic metabolic alterations in SBMA muscle and link lipid/glucose metabolism to pathogenesis. Moreover, our results highlight an HFD regime as a promising approach to support SBMA patients.",

Platelet Lysate (PL), a hemoderivate enriched with growth factors and cytokines has been largely tested in several clinical applications and as substitute of FBS in culture. Here, we investigate whether PL can exert biological effects on TF populations similarly to other cell types. Results show that PL significantly enhances cell proliferation and migration vs. FBS, without influencing cell size/granularity. Upregulation of EGF, VEGF, KDR, MMP2.9, FAK mRNA levels also occurs and phosphorylation of AKT but not of ERK1/2 is significantly enhanced. The inhibition of the PI3kinase/AKT pathway with the specific inhibitor wortmannin, decreases PL-induced cell migration but not proliferation. Condition supernatants containing PL show increased bioavailability of Nitric Oxide and reduced levels of 8-Iso-PGF2-alpha, correlating with cell proliferation and migration. Pro-angiogenic/inflammatory soluble factors (GRO, Angiogenin, EGF, I-309, PARC) are exclusively or greater expressed in media containing PL than FBS. GMPgrade PL preparations positively influence in vitro biological effects of TFs representing a suitable and safer alternative to FBS.",

Preliminary microRaman space resolved measurements were undertaken on a 100x100 μm2 2D array made up of 10 μm-spaced, 1 μm2 large clusters. The high surface enhanced Raman signal measured on the structure allowed us to point out a full correspondence in the periodical spacing both optically and topographically achieved.

            "abstract": "Membrane fission is an essential cellular process by which continuous membranes split into separate parts. We have previously identified CtBP1-S/BARS (BARS) as a key component of a protein complex that is required for fission of several endomembranes, including basolateral post-Golgi transport carriers. Assembly of this complex occurs at the Golgi apparatus, where BARS binds to the phosphoinositide kinase PI4KIIIβ through a 14-3-3γ dimer, as well as to ARF and the PKD and PAK kinases.We now report that, when incorporated into this complex, BARS binds to and activates a trans-Golgi lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) acyltransferase type δ(LPAATδ) that converts LPA into phosphatidic acid (PA); and that this reaction is essential for fission of the carriers. LPA and PA have unique biophysical properties, and their interconversion might facilitate the fission process either directly or indirectly (via recruitment of proteins that bind to PA, including BARS itself).",

The possibility to engineer graphene-based medical devices at the neuronal interface is of particular interest, making it imperative to determine the biocompatibility of graphene materials with neuronal cells. Here we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the effects of chronic and acute exposure of rat primary cortical neurons to few-layer pristine graphene (GR) and monolayer graphene oxide (GO) flakes. By combining a range of cell biology, microscopy, electrophysiology, and \"omics\" approaches we characterized the graphene-neuron interaction from the first steps of membrane contact and internalization to the long-term effects on cell viability, synaptic transmission, and cell metabolism. GR/GO flakes are found in contact with the neuronal membrane, free in the cytoplasm, and internalized through the endolysosomal pathway, with no significant impact on neuron viability. However, GO exposure selectively caused the inhibition of excitatory transmission, paralleled by a reduction in the number of excitatory synaptic contacts, and a concomitant enhancement of the inhibitory activity. This was accompanied by induction of autophagy, altered Ca2+ dynamics, and a downregulation of some of the main players in the regulation of Ca2+ homeostasis in both excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Our results show that, although graphene exposure does not impact neuron viability, it does nevertheless have important effects on neuronal transmission and network functionality, thus warranting caution when planning to employ this material for neurobiological applications.",

KGaA, WeinheimInterface engineering is performed by the addition of graphene and related 2 D materials (GRMs) into perovskite solar cells (PSCs), leading to improvements in the power conversion efficiency (PCE). By doping the mesoporous TiO2 layer with graphene flakes (mTiO2+G), produced by liquid-phase exfoliation of pristine graphite, and by inserting graphene oxide (GO) as an interlayer between the perovskite and hole-transport layers, using a two-step deposition procedure in air, we achieved a PCE of 18.2 %. The obtained PCE value mainly results from improved charge-carrier injection/collection with respect to conventional PSCs. Although the addition of GRMs does not influence the shelf life, it is beneficial for the stability of PSCs under several aging conditions. In particular, mTiO2+G PSCs retain more than 88 % of the initial PCE after 16 h of prolonged 1 sun illumination at the maximum power point. Moreover, when subjected to prolonged heating at 60 °C, the GO-based structures show enhanced stability with respect to mTiO2+G PSCs, as a result of thermally induced modification at the mTiO2+G/perovskite interface. The exploitation of GRMs in the form of dispersions and inks opens the way for scalable large-area production, advancing the possible commercialization of PSCs.",

            "abstract": "© 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. Reach-to-grasp movements performed without visual and haptic feedback of the hand are subject to systematic inaccuracies. Grasps directed at an object specified by binocular information usually end at the wrong distance with an incorrect final grip aperture. More specifically, moving the target object away from the observer leads to increasingly larger undershoots and smaller grip apertures. These systematic biases suggest that the visuomotor mapping is based on inaccurate estimates of an object’s egocentric distance and 3D structure that compress the visual space. Here we ask whether the appropriate visuomotor mapping can be learned through an extensive exposure to trials where haptic and visual feedback of the hand is provided. By intermixing feedback trials with test trials without feedback, we aimed at maximizing the likelihood that the motor execution of test trials is positively influenced by that of preceding feedback trials. We found that the intermittent presence of feedback trials both (1) largely reduced the positioning error of the hand with respect to the object and (2) affected the shaping of the hand before the final grasp, leading to an overall more accurate performance. While this demonstrates an effective transfer of information from feedback trials to test trials, the remaining biases indicate that a compression of visual space is still taking place. The correct visuomotor mapping, therefore, could not be learned. We speculate that an accurate reconstruction of the scene at movement onset may not actually be needed. Instead, the online monitoring of the hand position relative to the object and the final contact with the object are sufficient for a successful execution of a grasp.",

Yet the ability to glean information about object properties by observing graspingmovements is poorly understood. In this study, we capitalized on the effect of object size to investigatethe ability to discriminate the size of an invisible object from movement kinematics. The study consistedof 2 phases. In the first action execution phase, to assess grip scaling, we recorded and analyzedreach-to-grasp movements performed toward differently sized objects. In the second action observationphase, video clips of the corresponding movements were presented to participants in a two-alternativeforced-choice task. To probe discrimination performance over time, videos were edited to provideselective vision of different periods from 2 viewpoints. Separate analyses were conducted to determinehow the participants' ability to discriminate between stimulus alternatives (Type I sensitivity) and theirmetacognitive ability to discriminate between correct and incorrect responses (Type II sensitivity) variedover time and viewpoint. We found that as early as 80 ms after movement onset, participants were ableto discriminate object size from the observation of grasping movements delivered from the lateralviewpoint. For both viewpoints, information pickup closely matched the evolution of the hand'skinematics, reaching an almost perfect performance well before the fingers made contact with the object(60% of movement duration). These findings suggest that observers are able to decode object size fromkinematic sources specified early on in the movement.",

The evaluation of the grasping capabilities of such hands is a challenging task. This paper revisits some traditional quality measures developed for multi-fingered, fully actuated hands, and applies them to the case of underactuated hands. The extension of quality metrics for synergy-driven hands for the case of underactuated grasping is also presented. The performance of both types of measures is evaluated with simulated examples, concluding with a comparative discussion of their main features.",

            "abstract": "© 2015 Elsevier B.V. A green hydrothermal synthesis approach, which employs almost neutral pH conditions and ammonium carbonate as a structural directing agent, has been used for the preparation of W- and Mo-doped BiVO&lt;inf&gt;4&lt;/inf&gt; powders with a monoclinic scheelite-like structure and preferential growth along the {040} facet. The crystal structure and morphology of the samples have been studied by means of XRD and FESEM analyses. The proper introduction of the W and Mo dopants in the lattice of BiVO&lt;inf&gt;4&lt;/inf&gt; crystals has been confirmed from XRD and XPS analyses. Moreover, it has been shown that the superficial amount of W and Mo dopants (obtained by means of XPS) plays a more important role than the overall (bulk and surface) dopant quantities in the BiVO&lt;inf&gt;4&lt;/inf&gt; (estimated by means of ICPMS analysis). The best of the so prepared materials demonstrated an extraordinary enhancement of the water oxidation rate under simulated sunlight (i.e. 942μmol/g.h O&lt;inf&gt;2&lt;/inf&gt;), which is about two-fold and 100 times higher than those of a state-of-art Mo-doped and the non-doped BiVO&lt;inf&gt;4&lt;/inf&gt; reference materials, respectively. The here reported BiVO&lt;inf&gt;4&lt;/inf&gt; photocatalysts are highly promising for different applications such as renewable energy production systems (i.e. solar fuels production form water and sunlight) and to resolve environmental issues (i.e. photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants, water remediation, among others).",

Research in whole-body control (WBC) aims to contribute to provide robots with those capabilities that are necessary to move and perform in real world scenarios. Until recent years, limitations on hardware relegated WBC to almost purely theoretical research. Recently, a growing number of experimental platforms have become available (in particular, torque-controlled humanoids). This new opportunity has triggered the deployment on real robots of the theoretical outcomes of research in the field. This is backed up by a number of new research projects and initiatives addressing issues in this domain, including the Darpa robotic challenge (DRC). The goal of this special issue is to provide a clear representation of what is the state-of-the-art in WBC, and to help identifying what steps still need to be taken to have humanoid robots moving out of research laboratories to real world applications.",

            "abstract": "© 2012 IEEE.Traditional machine learning and pattern recognition techniques are intimately linked to the notion of feature spaces. Adopting this view, each object is described in terms of a vector of numerical attributes and is, therefore, mapped to a point in a Euclidean (geometric) vector space, so that the distances between the points reflect the observed (dis)similarities between the respective objects. This kind of representation is attractive because geometric spaces offer powerful analytical as well as computational tools that are simply not available in other representations. Indeed, classical machine learning methods are tightly related to geometrical concepts, and numerous powerful tools have been developed during the last few decades, starting from the maximal likelihood method in the 1920s to perceptrons in the 1960s and, more recently, to kernel machines and deep learning architectures.",

            "abstract": "Â© 2016 Elsevier B.V.The term ‘synergy’ – from the Greek synergia – means ‘working together’. The concept of multiple elements working together towards a common goal has been extensively used in neuroscience to develop theoretical frameworks, experimental approaches, and analytical techniques to understand neural control of movement, and for applications for neuro-rehabilitation. In the past decade, roboticists have successfully applied the framework of synergies to create novel design and control concepts for artificial hands, i.e., robotic hands and prostheses. At the same time, robotic research on the sensorimotor integration underlying the control and sensing of artificial hands has inspired new research approaches in neuroscience, and has provided useful instruments for novel experiments. The ambitious goal of integrating expertise and research approaches in robotics and neuroscience to study the properties and applications of the concept of synergies is generating a number of multidisciplinary cooperative projects, among which the recently finished 4-year European project “The Hand Embodied” (THE). This paper reviews the main insights provided by this framework. Specifically, we provide an overview of neuroscientific bases of hand synergies and introduce how robotics has leveraged the insights from neuroscience for innovative design in hardware and controllers for biomedical engineering applications, including myoelectric hand prostheses, devices for haptics research, and wearable sensing of human hand kinematics. The review also emphasizes how this multidisciplinary collaboration has generated new ways to conceptualize a synergy-based approach for robotics, and provides guidelines and principles for analyzing human behavior and synthesizing artificial robotic systems based on a theory of synergies.",

Robots can access areas too small or deep for a person, can begin surveying larger areas that people are not permitted to enter and can carry sensors and instruments. One important aspect in this cooperative framework is the way robots and humans can communicate during rescue operation. Vision and audio modalities may result not efficient in case of reduced visibility or high noise. A promising way to guarantee effective communications between robot and human in a team is the exploitation of haptic signals. In this work, we present a possible solution to let a robot guide the position of a human operator's hand by using vibrations. We demonstrate that an armband embedding four vibrating motors is enough to guide the wrist of an operator along a predefined path or in a target location. The results proposed can be exploited in human-robot teams. For instance, when the robot detects the position of a sensible target, it can guide the wrist of the operator in such position following an optimal path.",

The reduced Hartree parameter is used together with the conventional meta-generalized gradient approximation (meta-GGA) semilocal ingredients (i.e., the electron density, its gradient, and the kinetic energy density) to construct a new generation exchange functional, termed u-meta-GGA. This u-meta-GGA functional is exact for the exchange of any one- and two-electron systems, is size-consistent and non-empirical, satisfies the uniform density scaling relation, and recovers the modified gradient expansion derived from the semiclassical atom theory. For atoms, ions, jellium spheres, and molecules, it shows a good accuracy, being often better than meta-GGA exchange functionals. Our construction validates the use of the reduced Hartree ingredient in exchange-correlation functional development, opening the way to an additional rung in the Jacob's ladder classification of non-empirical density functionals.",

In particular, at five different pH values the conformational and structural changes of the BSA during all the steps of the thermal aggregation and gelation have been analyzed by FTIR spectroscopy. The macroscopic mechanical properties of these hydrogels have been obtained by rheological measurements. The microscopic structure of the gels have been studied by AFM and SEM images to have a picture of their different spatial arrangement.

Human hemoglobin (Hb) is conjugated to the surface of gelatin microspheres (GM) to produce gelatin hemoglobin oxygen depot (G-HbOD). G-HbOD is obtained by means of two different conjugation strategies. The degree of conjugation of GM surfaces in terms of free amino groups by using HPLC is first evaluated. By following the strategy A (G-HbOD_A), Hb is conjugated to GM by means of the formation of a polyurethane linker. In the strategy B (G-HbOD_B) the conjugation occurs via amide bound formation. Physical and morphological differences between G-HbOD_A and G-HbOD_B are investigated by means of Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-OES), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). Differences in oxygen uptake/release kinetics are found depending on the conjugation strategy and it is proved that G-HbOD works under repeated cycles in microfluidic chip. Moreover, G-HbOD is also able to work as oxygen depot in the early stages of 3D cell cultures.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 IEEE.Exoskeletons offer an intuitive method for actuating multiple DOF of the body; this makes them attractive for applications where generation and coupling of artificial forces to the limbs is needed. Force feedback hand exoskeletons have been continuously considered for whole hand haptic interaction in virtual reality simulators, in teleoperation setups and for rehabilitation. In hand exoskeletons finger tracking, actuation and transmission systems must be embedded in confined spaces, matching at the same time the profound dexterity of the hand transparently and without causing a burden. Most of the design approaches for such systems have remained largely experimental due to hardware limitations, impacting heavily on important functional and ergonomic factors. This paper presents the design of a novel 3-digit hand exoskeleton, which addresses the issues of finger tracking and force feedback. It proposes a new approach for the application of the feedback force with a single attachment at the fingertip through a 6DoF kinematic chain. This kinematic linkage allows for unconstrained reach of the fingers within their full workspace and facilitates a sensor system for high resolution 6DOF tracking of the fingertips. At the same time the highly under-actuated mechanism permits application of a bidirectional feedback force at the fingertips. The hand exoskeleton fits an large range of hand sizes and requires no mechanical alignment between the linkage and the fingers, whatsoever. Preliminary results show the efficacy of this system as a tracking and force feedback device for the hand.",

The three members of the hierarchy, ordered by decreasing complexity, are: (i) a 3D Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) PDE system for ion concentrations and electric potential; (ii) a 2D reduced PNP system for the same dependent variables as in (i); (iii) a 2D area-contact PDE system for electric potential coupled with a system of ODEs for ion concentrations. The backward Euler method is adopted for temporal semi-discretization and a fixed-point iteration based on Gummel's map is used to decouple system equations. Spatial discretization is performed using piecewise linear triangular finite elements stabilized via edge-based exponential fitting. Extensively conducted simulation results are in excellent agreement with existing analytical solutions of the PNP problem in radial coordinates and experimental and simulated data using simplified lumped parameter models.",

We present an approach for stable object grasping and simultaneous grip strength control using tactile feedback, which is able to deal with unknown objects of different shape, size and material. We develop a generic method that exploits the structure of an anthropomorphic hand to be simple and effective. Our approach uses techniques from classical control theory to develop a controller in charge of coordinating the fingers for achieving grasp stabilization and grip strength control. Then, we applied a machine learning method based on Gaussian mixture model regression, with the aim of further improving stability and increasing robustness to external perturbations. The method has been validated on the iCub robot. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our approach.",

In fact, complex maneuvers need to consider dynamic movement and contact events at the same time. We present a hierarchical trajectory optimization approach for planning dynamic movements with unscheduled contact sequences. We compute whole-body motions that achieve goals that cannot be reached in a kinematic fashion. First, we find a feasible CoM motion according to the centroidal dynamics of the robot. Then, we refine the solution by applying the robot's full-dynamics model, where the feasible CoM trajectory is used as a warm-start point. To accomplish the unscheduled contact behavior, we use complementarity constraints to describe the contact model, i.e. environment geometry and non-sliding active contacts. Both optimization phases are posed as Mathematical Program with Complementarity Constraints (MPCC). Experimental trials demonstrate the performance of our planning approach in a set of challenging tasks.",

KGaA, Weinheim A pH-based method to tune the tribological and wetting properties of a coating obtained from water-dispersed perfluorinated acrylic copolymer is demonstrated. The surface-exposed fluorinated chains and chemical charges of the sprayed coatings can be controlled simply by tuning the pH of the initial water dispersion. The surface properties of the sprayed polymeric coatings remain unmodified when the pH of the water dispersion is reduced (addition of HCl). On the contrary, from dispersions with increased pH (addition of NaOH) a fluoroacrylic polyelectrolyte polymer is formed and clear variations in wetting and tribological properties of the polymeric coatings are observed. Interestingly, coatings’ surface adhesion to vulcanizing rubber can be strongly reduced when the pH of the dispersions is in the range 4.5–6.0, which corresponds to a specific ratio between fluorinated chains and chemical charges. Consequently, such coatings can be proposed as low-cost and easy-to-apply alternatives to aqueous release agents for the rubber tires demolding processes, thus having significant implications for the automotive tire industry.",

Layers of transparent hydrogel electrodes sandwich a ZnS phosphor-doped dielectric elastomer layer, creating thin rubber sheets that change illuminance and capacitance under deformation. Arrays of individually controllable pixels in thin rubber sheets were fabricated using replica molding and were subjected to stretching, folding, and rolling to demonstrate their use as stretchable displays.

KGaA, Weinheim Interdependence of chemical structure, thin-film morphology, and transport properties is a key, yet often elusive aspect characterizing the design and development of high-mobility, solution-processed polymers for large-area and flexible electronics applications. There is a specific need to achieve &gt;1 cm2 V−1 s−1 field-effect mobilities (μ) at low processing temperatures in combination with environmental stability, especially in the case of electron-transporting polymers, which are still lagging behind hole transporting materials. Here, the synthesis of a naphthalene-diimide based donor–acceptor copolymer characterized by a selenophene vinylene selenophene donor moiety is reported. Optimized field-effect transistors show maximum μ of 2.4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and promising ambient stability. A very marked film structural evolution is revealed with increasing annealing temperature, with evidence of a remarkable 3D crystallinity above 180 °C. Conversely, transport properties are found to be substantially optimized at 150 °C, with limited gain at higher temperature. This discrepancy is rationalized by the presence of a surface-segregated prevalently edge-on packed polymer phase, dominating the device accumulated channel. This study therefore serves the purpose of presenting a promising, high-electron-mobility copolymer that is processable at relatively low temperatures, and of clearly highlighting the necessity of specifically investigating channel morphology in assessing the structure–property nexus in semiconducting polymer thin films.",

Such probe proved efficient in target detection in different contests and specific even in presence of serum proteins. The conjugation of double strand probes onto polymeric microgels allows for a sensitive detection of DNA sequences from HIV, HCV and SARS corona viruses with a LOD of 1.4 fM, 3.7 fM and 1.4 fM, respectively, and with a dynamic range of 10-9-10-15 M. Such combination enhances the sensitivity of the detection of almost five orders of magnitude when compared to the only probe.

Three-dimensional (3D) graphene-based structures combine the unique physical properties of graphene with the opportunity to get high electrochemically available surface area per unit of geometric surface area. Several preparation techniques have been reported to fabricate 3D graphene-based macroscopic structures for energy storage applications such as supercapacitors. Although reaserch has been focused so far on achieving either high specific capacitance or high volumetric capacitance, much less attention has been dedicated to obtain high specific and high volumetric capacitance simultaneously. Here, we present a facile technique to fabricate graphene foams (GF) of high crystal quality with tunable pore size grown by chemical vapor deposition. We exploited porous sacrificial templates prepared by sintering nickel and copper metal powders. Tuning the particle size of the metal powders and the growth temperature allow fine control of the resulting pore size of the 3D graphene-based structures smaller than 1 &amp;mu;m. The as-produced 3D graphene structures provide a high volumetric electric double layer capacitance (165 mF cm-3). High specific capacitance (100 Fg-1) is obtained by lowering the number of layers down to single layer graphene. Furthermore, the small pore size increases the stability of these GFs in contrast to the ones that have been grown so far on commercial metal foams. Electrodes based on the as-prepared GFs can be a boost for the development of supercapacitors, where both low volume and mass are required.",

Metallic nanostructures can be utilized as heat nano-sources which can find application in different areas such as photocatalysis, nanochemistry or sensor devices. Here we show how the optical response of plasmonic structures is affected by the increase of temperature. In particular we apply a temperature dependent dielectric function model to different nanoparticles finding that the optical responses are strongly dependent on shape and aspect-ratio. The idea is that when metallic structures interact with an electromagnetic field they heat up due to Joule effect. The corresponding temperature increase modifies the optical response of the particle and thus the heating process. The key finding is that, depending on the structures geometry, absorption efficiency can either increase or decrease with temperature. Since absorption relates to thermal energy dissipation and thus to temperature increase, the mechanism leads to positive or negative loops. Consequently, not only an error would be made by neglecting temperature but it would be not even possible to know, a priori, if the error is towards higher or lower values.",

H3K9me3 mediated gene silencing may result from other KDMs such as G9a/GLP, SUV39H1-2, SETDB1, CCLD8 and RIZ1. Their disturbance leads to defective cell mitosis. It is therefore desirable to find small molecules that are able to decrease H3K9 and K27 tagging to reinitiate gene transcription. Most KDM inhibitors are still based on SAM co-factor competition/modulation.

Accordingly, TAAR1 is considered a promising target for medicinal development. To gain more insights into TAAR1 physiological functions and validation of its therapeutic potential, we recently developed a new class of thyronamine-like derivatives. Among them compound SG2 showed high affinity and potent agonist activity at mouse TAAR1. In the present work, we describe design, synthesis, and SAR study of a new series of compounds (1-16) obtained by introducing specific structural changes at key points of our lead compound SG2 skeleton. Five of the newly synthesized compounds displayed mTAAR1 agonist activity higher than both SG2 and T1AM.

We investigated the immediate and the transitionary effects of supportive hand contacts during continuous anteroposterior perturbations of stance by automated waist-pulls. Ten young adults were perturbed for 5 min and required to maintain balance by holding to a stationary, shoulder-high handle and following its removal. Center of pressure (COP) displacement, hip, knee and ankle angles, leg and trunk muscle activity and handle contact forces were acquired. The analysis of results show that COP excursions are significantly smaller when the subjects utilize supportive hand contact and that the displacement of COP is strongly correlated to the perturbation force and significantly larger in the anterior than posterior direction. Regression analysis of hand forces revealed that subjects utilized the hand support significantly more during the posterior than anterior perturbations. Moreover, kinematical analysis showed that utilization of supportive hand contacts alter posture of the whole body and that postural readjustments after the release of the handle, occur at different time scales in the hip, knee and ankle joints. Overall, our findings show that supportive hand contacts are efficiently used for balance control during continuous postural perturbations and that utilization of a handle has significant immediate and transitionary effects on whole body posture.",

Learning embeddings of entities and relations is an efficient and versatile method to perform machine learning on relational data such as knowledge graphs. In this work, we propose holographic embeddings (HOLE) to learn compositional vector space representations of entire knowledge graphs. The proposed method is related to holographic models of associative memory in that it employs circular correlation to create compositional representations. By using correlation as the compositional operator, HOLE can capture rich interactions but simultaneously remains efficient to compute, easy to train, and scalable to very large datasets. Experimentally, we show that holographic embeddings are able to outperform state-ofthe-Art methods for link prediction on knowledge graphs and relational learning benchmark datasets.",

KGaA, WeinheimSmart surfaces with a tunable wetting behavior between superhydrophobic and superhydrophilic states are of great interest for different applications, such as novel self-cleaning/antifogging layers, or in view of the development of microfluidic devices and chemical/biochemical sensors of new generation. This work shows the tuning of the wetting behavior of hydrothermally grown zinc oxide nanowires (NWs) by combining the dual effect resulting from either surface chemical functionalization of the NWs and their growth on substrates prepatterned with different micro-sized geometries. The characterization results highlight that vertically aligned ZnO NWs successfully cover all the microfeatures of the patterned substrates and can be successfully functionalized with aminopropyl groups. This chemical functionalization drives the initial transition of as-prepared, superhydrophilic ZnO NWs toward a superhydrophobic regime. Then, protonation/deprotonation of amine groups, induced by their interaction with acid or basic media, changes the wetting state of ZnO NWs between hydrophilic and hydrophobic regimes. Reversible and successful switching from hydrophobic to hydrophilic states can be achieved under ad hoc conditions, in particular using appropriate micropatterns that do not favor the formation and entrapment of air bubbles.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 American Chemical Society. A number of structural factors modulate the activity of Abelson (Abl) tyrosine kinase, whose deregulation is often related to oncogenic processes. First, only the open conformation of the Abl kinase domain's activation loop (A-loop) favors ATP binding to the catalytic cleft. In this regard, the trans-autophosphorylation of the Y412 residue, which is located along the A-loop, favors the stability of the open conformation, in turn enhancing Abl activity. Another key factor for full Abl activity is the formation of active conformations of the catalytic DFG motif in the Abl kinase domain. Furthermore, binding of the SH2 domain to the N-lobe of the Abl kinase was recently demonstrated to have a long-range allosteric effect on the stabilization of the A-loop open state. Intriguingly, these distinct structural factors imply a complex signal transmission network for controlling the A-loop's flexibility and conformational preference for optimal Abl function. However, the exact dynamical features of this signal transmission network structure remain unclear. Here, we report on microsecond-long molecular dynamics coupled with enhanced sampling simulations of multiple Abl model systems, in the presence or absence of the SH2 domain and with the DFG motif flipped in two ways (in or out conformation). Through comparative analysis, our simulations augment the interpretation of the existing Abl experimental data, revealing a dynamical network of interactions that interconnect SH2 domain binding with A-loop plasticity and Y412 autophosphorylation in Abl. This signaling network engages the DFG motif and, importantly, other conserved structural elements of the kinase domain, namely, the EPK-ELK H-bond network and the HRD motif. Our results show that the signal propagation for modulating the A-loop spatial localization is highly dependent on the HRD motif conformation, which thus acts as the central hub of this (allosteric) signaling network controlling Abl activation and function.",

Moreover, recent evidence indicates that chaperones can act as potentially strong suppressor agents in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Indeed, in vitro experiments demonstrate that several chaperones are able to significantly slow down or suppress aggregation of Aβ peptide and in vivo studies reveal that treatment with specific chaperones or their overexpression can ameliorate some distinct pathological signs characterizing AD. Methods Here we investigate using a biophysical approach (fluorescence, circular dichroism (CD), transmission electron (TEM) and atomic force (AFM) microscopy, size exclusion chromatography (SEC)) the effect of the human chaperonin Hsp60 on Aβ fibrillogenesis. Results We found that Hsp60 powerfully inhibits Aβ amyloid aggregation, by closing molecular pathways leading to peptide fibrillogenesis. Conclusions We observe that Hsp60 inhibits Aβ aggregation through a more complex mechanism than a simple folding chaperone action. The action is specifically directed toward the early oligomeric species behaving as aggregation seeds for on-pathway amyloid fibrillogenesis. General significance Understanding the specificity of the molecular interactions of Hsp60 with amyloid Aβ peptide allowed us to emphasize the important aspects to be taken into consideration when considering the recent promising therapeutic strategies for neurodegeneration",

However, in some instances, the heavily compromised health of the patient can either impair or limit the recovery of the autologous chondrocytes and a satisfactory outcome of the implant. Allogeneic human articular chondrocytes (hAC) could be a good alternative, but the possible immunological incompatibility between recipient and hAC donor should be considered. Herein, we report that allogeneic hAC inhibited T lymphocyte response to antigen-dependent and -independent proliferative stimuli. This effect was maximal when T cells and hAC were in contact and it was not relieved by the addition of exogenous lymphocyte growth factor interleukin (IL)-2. More important, hAC impaired the differentiation of peripheral blood monocytes induced with granulocyte monocyte colony-stimulating factor and IL-4 (Mo) to professional antigen-presenting cells, such as dendritic cells (DC). Indeed, a marked inhibition of the onset of the CD1a expression and an ineffective downregulation of CD14 antigens was observed in Mo-hAC co-cultures. Furthermore, compared to immature or mature DC, Mo from Mo-hAC co-cultures did not trigger an efficacious allo-response. The prostaglandin (PG) E2 present in the Mo-hAC co-culture conditioned media is a putative candidate of the hAC-mediated inhibition of Mo maturation. Altogether, these findings indicate that allogeneic hAC inhibit, rather than trigger, immune response and strongly suggest that an efficient chondrocyte implantation could be possible also in an allogeneic setting.",

Different methods to generate grasp trajectories (way-points made by end-effector positions and its joint values) have been investigated such as kinaesthetic teaching, grasp recording using motion capture systems, and others. Although these method could potentially lead to a good trajectory, usually they are only able to give a good initial guess for a successful grasp: in fact, obtained trajectories seldom transfer well to the robot without further processing. In this work, we propose a ROS/Gazebo based interactive framework to create and modify grasping trajectories for different robotic end-effectors. This tool allows to shape the various way-points of a considered trajectory, and test it in a simulated environment, leading to a trial-and-error procedure and eventually to the real hardware application.",

Many central nervous system (CNS) diseases including stroke, spinal cord injury (SCI), and brain tumors are a significant cause of worldwide morbidity/mortality and yet do not have satisfying treatments. Cell-based therapy to restore lost function or to carry new therapeutic genes is a promising new therapeutic approach, particularly after human iPSCs became available. However, efficient generation of footprint-free and xeno-free human iPSC is a prerequisite for their clinical use. In this paper, we will first summarize the current methodology to obtain footprint- and xeno-free human iPSC. We will then review the current iPSC applications in therapeutic approaches for CNS regeneration and their use as vectors to carry proapoptotic genes for brain tumors and review their applications for modelling of neurological diseases and formulating new therapeutic approaches. Available results will be summarized and compared. Finally, we will discuss current limitations precluding iPSC from being used on large scale for clinical applications and provide an overview of future areas of improvement. In conclusion, significant progress has occurred in deriving iPSC suitable for clinical use in the field of neurological diseases. Current efforts to overcome technical challenges, including reducing labour and cost, will hopefully expedite the integration of this technology in the clinical setting.",

KGaA, WeinheimWe used starches from two different Andean-native tubers to prepare nano-sized particles, and tested their ability to stimulate inflammatory reactions in human monocytes. Our data show that the release of inflammatory cytokines by monocytes can be differentially modulated by the administration of non-toxic doses of nanoparticles synthesized from the starch of the Andean sub-species Solanum tuberosum and Solanum goniocalyx. Furthermore, we observed a starch-nanoparticle-specific increase in inflammatory chemokine-dependent migration, and an up-regulation of immunoglobulin receptor CD16. Based on this preliminary study, we conclude that different potato starch nanoparticles possess specific properties that can induce immune responses and may be employed as immune modulators in the future.",

Brain imaging studies have shown that observation of both bodily movements and abstract motion displays complying with human kinematics activate the observer's motor cortex. However, it is unknown whether the same processes are active in the two conditions. Here, we addressed this issue using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to directly compare cortico-spinal excitability during observation of actions and motion stimuli that complied with or violated normal human kinematics.We found that kinematics significantly modulated the motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) produced by TMS during observation of both human and abstract motion stimuli. However, only the temporal unfolding of cortico-spinal excitability during observation of human movements significantly correlated with instantaneous stimulus velocity. This correlation was present for normal movements and also for a subset of the movements having unnatural kinematics. Furthermore, bodily movements for which we found no correlation between MEPs and stimulus velocity produced significantly higher MEPs.Our novel results suggest a dissociation in how human movements and abstract motion displays engage the observer's motor system. Specifically, while both stimulus types significantly activate the observer's motor cortex, only bodily movements produce patterns of cortico-spinal excitability that closely follow the velocity profile of the observed movement. This internal \"re-enactment\" of observed bodily movements seems to be only partially attuned to normal human kinematics.",

Emerging studies indicate that several species such as corvids, apes and children solve 'The Crow and the Pitcher' task (from Aesop's Fables) in diverse conditions. Hidden beneath this fascinating paradigm is a fundamental question: by cumulatively interacting with different objects, how can an agent abstract the underlying cause-effect relations to predict and creatively exploit potential affordances of novel objects in the context of sought goals? Re-enacting this Aesop's Fable task on a humanoid within an open-ended 'learning-prediction-abstraction' loop, we address this problem and (i) present a brain-guided neural framework that emulates rapid one-shot encoding of ongoing experiences into a long-term memory and (ii) propose four task-agnostic learning rules (elimination, growth, uncertainty and status quo) that correlate predictions from remembered past experiences with the unfolding present situation to gradually abstract the underlying causal relations. Driven by the proposed architecture, the ensuing robot behaviours illustrated causal learning and anticipation similar to natural agents. Results further demonstrate that by cumulatively interacting with few objects, the predictions of the robot in case of novel objects converge close to the physical law, i.e. the Archimedes principle: this being independent of both the objects explored during learning and the order of their cumulative exploration.",

Here, we investigate the role of this up-regulation. The obtained results indicate that E2 promotes NGB-HTT association, induces the localization of the complex at the mitochondria, and protects SK-N-BE neuroblastoma cells and murine striatal cells, which express wild-type HTT (i.e., polyQ7), against H2O2-induced apoptosis. All E2 effects were completely abolished in HTT-knocked out SK-N-BE cells and in striatal neurons expressing the mutated form of HTT (mHTT; i.e., polyQ111) typical of Huntington’s disease (HD). As a whole, these data provide a new function of wild-type HTT which drives E2-induced NGB in mitochondria modulating NGB anti-apoptotic activity. This new function is lost by HTT polyQ pathological expansion. These data evidence the existence of a novel E2/HTT/NGB neuroprotective axis that may play a relevant role in the development of HD therapeutics.",

Despite the theoretical simplicity of such a photoelectrochemical device, different limitations among candidate semiconductor materials have hindered its development. After many decades of research on inorganic semiconductors, a conclusive solution still appears out of reach. Here, we report an efficient hybrid organic-inorganic H2 evolving photocathode, consisting of a donor/acceptor blend sandwiched between charge-selective layers and a thin electrocatalyst layer. The role and stability of the different interfaces are investigated, and the conductive polymer is proven to be an efficient material for a semiconductor/liquid PEC junction. The best performing electrodes show high performances with a photocurrent of 3 mA cm-2 at 0 V vs. RHE, optimal process stability with 100% faradaic efficiency during electrode's lifetime, excellent energetics with +0.67 V vs. RHE onset potential, promising operational activity of several hours and by-design compatibility for implementation in a tandem architecture. This work demonstrates organic semiconductors as a radically new option for efficient direct conversion of solar energy into fuels, and points out the route towards high performance organic photoelectrochemical water splitting.",

These are hydrated analogs of the magnetically frustrated, mixed-valent manganese oxide structures, with general formula, NaxMnO2. Here we demonstrate that the direct hydration of layered rock-salt type α-NaMnO2, with the geometrically frustrated triangular lattice topology, yields the birnessite type oxide, Na0.36MnO2·0.2H2O, transforming its magnetic properties. This compound has a much-expanded interlayer spacing compared to its parent α-NaMnO2 compound. We show that while the parent α-NaMnO2 possesses a Néel temperature of 45 K as a result of broken symmetry in the Mn3+ sublattice, the hydrated derivative undergoes collective spin freezing at 29 K within the Mn3+/Mn4+ sublattice. Scaling-law analysis of the frequency dispersion of the ac susceptibility, as well as the temperature-dependent, low-field dc magnetization confirm a cooperative spin-glass state of strongly interacting spins. This is supported by complementary spectroscopic analysis [high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron miscroscopy (TEM), energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, and electron energy-loss spectroscopy] as well as by a structural investigation (high-resolution TEM, x-ray, and neutron powder diffraction) that yield insights into the chemical and atomic structure modifications. We conclude that the spin-glass state in birnessite is driven by the spin frustration imposed by the underlying triangular lattice topology that is further enhanced by the in-plane bond-disorder generated by the mixed-valent character of manganese in the layers.",

The hydrodynamics of a flagellated micro-organism is investigated when swimming close to a planar free-slip surface by means of numerical solutions of the Stokes equations obtained via a boundary element method. Depending on the initial conditions, the swimmer can either escape from the free-slip surface or collide with the boundary. Interestingly, the micro-organism does not exhibit a stable orbit. Independently of escape or attraction to the interface, close to a free-slip surface, the swimmer follows a counter-clockwise trajectory, in agreement with experimental findings (Di Leonardo et al., Phys. Rev. Lett., vol. 106 (3), 2011, 038101). The hydrodynamics is indeed modified by the free surface. In fact, when the same swimmer moves close to a no-slip wall, a set of initial conditions exists which result in stable orbits. Moreover, when moving close to a free-slip or a no-slip boundary, the swimmer assumes a different orientation with respect to its trajectory. Taken together, these results contribute to shed light on the hydrodynamical behaviour of micro-organisms close to liquid-air interfaces which are relevant for the formation of interfacial biofilms of aerobic bacteria.",

The photopolymerization process was investigated and the films were fully characterized. Contact angle measurements with water on UV-cured films showed a linear increase of the contact angle of cross-linked films by increasing the functionalized SiO2 content in the photocurable formulation. Also, a consistent and linear improvement of penetration resistance was noted in terms of penetration depth by increasing the fluorinated functionalized silica content.

Recently, an antisense lncRNA to mouse Ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase L1 (Uchl1) was reported to increase UCHL1 protein synthesis, representing a new functional class of lncRNAs, designated as SINEUPs, for SINE element-containing translation UP-regulators. Here, we show that an antisense lncRNA to the human protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 12A (PPP1R12A), named as R12A-AS1, which overlaps with the 5′ UTR and first coding exon of the PPP1R12A mRNA, functions as a SINEUP, increasing PPP1R12A protein translation in human cells. The SINEUP activity depends on the aforementioned sense-antisense interaction and a free right Alu monomer repeat element at the 3′ end of R12A-AS1. In addition, we identify another human antisense lncRNA with SINEUP activity. Our results demonstrate for the first time that human natural antisense lncRNAs can up-regulate protein translation, suggesting that endogenous SINEUPs may be widespread and present in many mammalian species.",

However, the gene expression programs that depend upon sustained MYC activity remain unknown. In this study, we employed a mouse model of liver carcinoma driven by a reversible tet-MYC transgene, combined with chromatin immunoprecipitation and gene expression profiling to identify MYC-dependent regulatory events. As previously reported, MYC-expressing mice exhibited hepatoblastoma- and hepatocellular carcinoma-like tumors, which regressed when MYC expression was suppressed. We further show that cellular transformation, and thus initiation of liver tumorigenesis, were impaired in mice harboring a MYC mutant unable to associate with the corepressor protein MIZ1 (ZBTB17). Notably, switching off the oncogene in advanced carcinomas revealed that MYC was required for the continuous activation and repression of distinct sets of genes, constituting no more than half of all genes deregulated during tumor progression and an even smaller subset of all MYC-bound genes. Altogether, our data provide the first detailed analysis of a MYC-dependent transcriptional program in a fully developed carcinoma and offer a guide to identifying the critical effectors contributing to MYC-driven tumor maintenance.",

A deeper knowledge of the signaling pathways contributing to MB formation and aggressiveness would help develop new successful therapies. The target of rapamycin, mTOR signaling, is known to be involved in MB and is already targetable in the clinical setting. Furthermore, mTOR is a master metabolic regulator able to control cell growth versus autophagy decisions in conditions of amino-acid deprivation that can be due to IDO1 enzymatic activity. IDO1 has been also implicated in the regulation of inflammation, as well as of T cell-mediated immune responses, in a variety of pathological conditions, including brain tumors. In particular, IDO1 induces expansion of regulatory T-cells (Treg), preventing immune response against tumor cells. Analysis of 27 MB tissue specimens for the expression of both mTOR and IDO1 showed their widespread expression in all samples. Testing their cooperation in vitro, a significant involvement of IDO1 in mTOR immunogenic pathway was found, able to counteract the aim of rapamycin treatment. In MB cell lines, inhibition of mTOR strongly induced IDO1 expression and activity, corroborating its ability to recruit Treg cells in the tumor microenvironment. The mTOR/IDO1 cross talk was found to be strictly specific of MB cells. We demonstrated that mTOR pathway cross talks with IDO1 pathway to promote MB immune escape, possibly contributing to failure of mTOR- targeted therapy.",

Regulatory T cells represent a physiologic checkpoint in the balance between immunity and tolerance, requiring fine and rapid controls. Here, we show that human regulatory T cells are particularly sensitive to the sequential effects of IFN-α. First, IFN-α exerts a rapid, antiproliferative and proapoptotic effect in vitro and in vivo, as early as after 2 d of pegylated IFN/ ribavirin therapy in patients with chronic hepatitis C. Such activities result in the decline, at d 2, in circulating regulatory T cell frequency and specifically of the activated regulatory T cell subset. Later, IFN-based therapy restrains the fraction of regulatory T cells that can be polarized into IFN-γ-producing Th1-like regulatory T cells known to contribute to chronic immune activation in type 1 inflammation. Indeed, Th1-like regulatory T cell frequency significantly declines after 30 d of therapy in vivo in relation to the persistent decline of relevant IL-12 sources, namely, myeloid and 6-sulfo LacNAc-expressing dendritic cells. This event is recapitulated by experiments in vitro, providing evidence that itmay be attributable to the inhibitory effect of IFN-α on IL-12-induced, Th1-like regulatory T cell polarization. In summary, our results suggest that IFN-α-driven, early regulatory T cell depletion contributes to the development of antiviral immunity, ultimately resulting in the resolution of type 1 inflammation.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 The Author(s). Background: Increasing evidence suggests that the immune system has a beneficial role in the progression of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) although the mechanism remains unclear. Recently, we demonstrated that motor neurons (MNs) of C57SOD1G93A mice with slow disease progression activate molecules classically involved in the cross-talk with the immune system. This happens a lot less in 129SvSOD1G93A mice which, while expressing the same amount of transgene, had faster disease progression and earlier axonal damage. The present study investigated whether and how the immune response is involved in the preservation of motor axons in the mouse model of familial ALS with a more benign disease course. Methods: First, the extent of axonal damage, Schwann cell proliferation, and neuromuscular junction (NMJ) denervation were compared between the two ALS mouse models at the disease onset. Then, we compared the expression levels of different immune molecules, the morphology of myelin sheaths, and the presence of blood-derived immune cell infiltrates in the sciatic nerve of the two SOD1G93A mouse strains using immunohistochemical, immunoblot, quantitative reverse transcription PCR, and rotating-polarization Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Scattering techniques. Results: Muscle denervation, axonal dysregulation, and myelin disruption together with reduced Schwann cell proliferation are prominent in 129SvSOD1G93A compared to C57SOD1G93A mice at the disease onset, and this correlates with a faster disease progression in the first strain. On the contrary, a striking increase of immune molecules such as CCL2, MHCI, and C3 was seen in sciatic nerves of slow progressor C57SOD1G93A mice and this was accompanied by heavy infiltration of CD8+ T lymphocytes and macrophages. These phenomena were not detectable in the peripheral nervous system of fast-progressing mice. Conclusions: These data show for the first time that damaged MNs in SOD1-related ALS actively recruit immune cells in the peripheral nervous system to delay muscle denervation and prolong the lifespan. On the contrary, the lack of this response has a negative impact on the disease course.",

Properties of water molecules at the interface between contrast agents (CAs) for magnetic resonance imaging and macromolecules could have a valuable impact on the effectiveness of metal chelates. Recent studies,indeed,demonstrated that polymer architectures could influence CAs’ relaxivity by modifying the correlation times of the metal chelate. However,an understanding of the physico-chemical properties of polymer/CA systems is necessary to improve the efficiency of clinically used CAs,still exhibiting low relaxivity. In this context,we investigate the impact of hyaluronic acid (HA) hydrogels on the relaxometric properties of Gd-DTPA,a clinically used CA,to understand better the determining role of the water,which is crucial for both the relaxation enhancement and the polymer conformation. To this aim,water self-diffusion coefficients,thermodynamic interactions and relaxometric properties of HA/Gd-DTPA solutions are studied through time-domain NMR relaxometry and isothermal titration calorimetry. We observed that the presence of Gd-DTPA could alter the polymer conformation and the behaviour of water molecules at the HA/Gd-DTPA interface,thus modulating the relaxivity of the system. In conclusion,the tunability of hydrogel structures could be exploited to improve magnetic properties of metal chelates,inspiring the development of new CAs as well as metallopolymer complexes with applications as sensors and memory devices.",

While torque control has already been implemented on a few humanoid robots, this is one of the first implementations of torque control on a robot that was originally built to be position controlled (iCub [F. Nori, S. Traversaro, J. Eljaik, F. Romano, A. Del Prete and D. Pucci, iCub whole-body control through force regulation on rigid non-coplanar contacts, Frontiers in Robotics and AI 2 (2015).] and Asimo [O. Khatib, P. Thaulad and J. Park, Torque-position transformer for task control of position controlled robots, 2008 IEEE Int. Conf. Robotics and Automation, May 2008, pp. 1729-1734.] being the first two, to the best of our knowledge). The challenge comes from both the hardware, which does not include joint-torque sensors and presents large friction due to the high-ratio gear boxes, and the software interface, which only accepts desired joint-angle commands (no motor current/voltage control). The contribution of the paper is to provide a complete methodology that is very likely to be reproduced as most robots are designed to provide only position control capabilities. Additionally, the method is validated by exhaustive experiments on one leg of the robot, including a comparison with the original position controller. We tested the torque controller in both motion control and cartesian force control. The torque control can track better a reference trajectory while using lower values for the feedback gains (up to 25%). Moreover, we verified the quality of the identified motor models by analyzing the contribution of the feedforward terms of our torque controller, which dominate the feedback terms.",

Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) can improve the quality of life of patients with sensory and motor disabilities by both decoding motor intentions expressed by neural activity, and by encoding artificially sensed information into patterns of neural activity elicited by causal interventions on the neural tissue. Yet, current BMIs can exchange relatively small amounts of information with the brain. This problem has proved difficult to overcome by simply increasing the number of recording or stimulating electrodes, because trial-to-trial variability of neural activity partly arises from intrinsic factors (collectively known as the network state) that include ongoing spontaneous activity and neuromodulation, and so is shared among neurons. Here we review recent progress in characterizing the state dependence of neural responses, and in particular of how neural responses depend on endogenous slow fluctuations of network excitability. We then elaborate on how this knowledge may be used to increase the amount of information that BMIs exchange with brain. Knowledge of network state can be used to fine-tune the stimulation pattern that should reliably elicit a target neural response used to encode information in the brain, and to discount part of the trial-by-trial variability of neural responses, so that they can be decoded more accurately.",

A novel human ferritin-based nanocarrier, composed of 24 modified monomers able to auto-assemble into a modified protein cage, was produced and used as selective carrier of anti-tumor payloads. Each modified monomer derives from the genetic fusion of two distinct modules, namely the heavy chain of human ferritin (HFt) and a stabilizing/protective PAS polypeptide sequence rich in proline (P), serine (S), and alanine (A) residues. Two genetically fused protein constructs containing PAS polymers with 40- and 75-residue lengths, respectively, were compared. They were produced and purified as recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli at high yields. Both preparations were highly soluble and stable in vitro as well as in mouse plasma. Size-exclusion chromatography, dynamic light scattering, and transmission electron microscopy results indicated that PASylated ferritins are fully assembled and highly monodispersed. In addition, yields and stability of encapsulated doxorubicin were significantly better for both HFt-PAS proteins than for wild-type HFt. Importantly, PAS sequences considerably prolonged the half-life of HFt in the mouse bloodstream. Finally, our doxorubicin-loaded nanocages preserved the pharmacological activity of the drug. Taken together, these results indicate that both of the developed HFt-PAS fusion proteins are promising nanocarriers for future applications in cancer therapy.",

There is mounting evidence that long-range charge separation determines the efficiency of organic photovoltaic cells, yet different mechanisms remain under debate. One class of proposed mechanism is ultrafast coherent long-range charge separation, and another is a slower process whereby charges incoherently hop apart with a transiently enhanced mobility due to morphology and disorder. Here, we use transient absorption spectroscopy to probe incoherent charge separation dynamics in two different ways. First, we use a family of polymers whose backbone structures allows us to compare 2- phase donor-acceptor morphologies with 3-phase morphologies that feature an intermixed region. In the 3-phase system, we see pronounced spectral signatures associated with charges (holes) occupying the disordered intermixed region, and we track separation via biased charge diffusion to more ordered neat regions on the timescale of hundreds of picoseconds. Secondly, by resolving bimolecular charge recombination at high excitation density, we show that charge mobilities must be substantially enhanced on early timescales, which may be sufficient for separation to occur. Together, these measurements provide support for models of incoherent and relatively slow charge separation.",

The results showed that there is a wide process parameter window for obtaining dense samples (with low porosity, &lt; 0.25 %) with a fine cellular dendritic microstructure. IN625 processed by DMLS showed higher mechanical properties with respect to the same alloy after casting. Moreover, after aging treatments, carried out between 700 °C and 800 °C for 24 hours, the Brinell hardness (HBW) increased about 30% due to the precipitation of different phases. The FESEM analysis on heat-treated IN625 confirmed the presence of different precipitates such as gamma double prime (γ″) phase, delta (δ) phase and other nanometric-sized phases. IN625 is generally used in applications that require high corrosion resistance from ambient to high temperature (up to 1000 °C). Therefore, the current research on heat-treated IN625 processed by DMLS could be useful for building components with high mechanical properties and high corrosion resistance in harsh environment.",

Given the recent evidence indicating that amphetamine derivatives may also act as direct agonists of the G protein-coupled trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1), we hypothesized that TAAR1 could contribute to the reinforcing and addictive properties of amphetamines. Accordingly, the present study aimed to investigate the role of TAAR1 in the effects of psychostimulants by analyzing context-dependent sensitization and conditioned place preference (CPP) to d-amphetamine (AMPH) in TAAR1-KO mice. In context-dependent sensitization experiment, TAAR1-KO mice showed higher conditioned locomotor responses compared to wild-type mice. In the CPP test, TAAR1-KO animals were also more sensitive to priming-induced reinstatement of AMPH-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) than wild type mice. Importantly, saline-treated and AMPH-treated mice lacking TAAR1 demonstrated significant alterations in the total levels and phosphorylation of the critical subunit of NMDA glutamate receptors, GluN1, in the striatum, suggesting a role of TAAR1 in the modulation of frontostriatal glutamate transmission; this effect could underlie the observed alterations in conditioning processes. In conclusion, our data suggest that TAAR1 receptors play an inhibitory role with respect to conditioned responses to AMPH by modulating, at least in part, corticostriatal glutamate transmission.",

            "abstract": "© 2014 Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd Aim: It has been found that long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) reduce the risk of progression to first episode of psychosis (FEP) and may offer a safe and efficacious strategy for selective and indicated prevention in young people with ultra-high-risk (UHR) states. An opportunity for exploring the trajectory of FEP and for investigating the efficacy of preventive treatments exists in 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS), which has a 30% psychotic transition rate. The fact that 22q11DS patients are more homogeneous than other UHR groups and are characterized by high level of negative symptoms provides a strong rationale for the use of PUFAs. The principal aim of the present trial is to investigate the effects of PUFAs in individuals with 22q11DS who are at UHR for developing FEP. Methods: A prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-centre study design will be used. Eighty individuals aged 12–26 will be randomly assigned to two treatment conditions. Results: The experimental group will receive PUFAs. The placebo group will receive paraffin oil. Standard clinical assessments and neuropsychological tests will be performed at baseline and at 8-, 12-, 26- and 52-week follow-up. Blood samples will be collected at baseline and after 12 weeks. This study is registered as an International Standard RCT, number 02070211. The corresponding author is supported by a NARSAD Young Investigator Award. Conclusions: This is the protocol of a planned study that aims to test the efficacy of PUFAs in the prodromal phase of FEP, in a specific syndrome where there is strong evidence that a high genetic load is involved in the disorder.",

Hydrophobins, produced by filamentous fungi, are small amphipathic proteins whose biological functions rely on their unique surface-activity properties. Understanding the mechanistic details of the multimerization process is of primary importance to clarify the interfacial activity of hydrophobins. We used free energy calculations to study the role of a flexible β-hairpin in the multimerization process in hydrophobin II from Trichoderma reesei (HFBI). We characterized how the displacement of this β-hairpin controls the stability of the monomers/dimers/tetramers in solution. The regulation of the oligomerization equilibrium of HFBI will necessarily affect its interfacial properties, fundamental for its biological function and for technological applications. Moreover, we propose possible routes for the multimerization process of HFBI in solution. This is the first case where a mechanism by which a flexible loop flanking a rigid patch controls the protein-protein binding equilibrium, already known for proteins with charged binding hot-spots, is described within a hydrophobic patch.",

The introduction of alkoxy chains in the molecular architecture of meso push-pull porphyrins is of paramount importance aiming at high performing dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) based on these specific sensitizers. Recently, we have demonstrated that the same approach is fruitful even if it is applied to tetraarylporphyrins with an acceptor/anchoring substituent in the β-pyrrolic position. In particular, among the ortho-ortho, the ortho-para and the ortho-functionalization of the aryl rings with an octyloxy chain, we identified the latter as the most performing in the series, showing a good balance between the dye loading and the reduction of π-π aggregation. Herein, focusing our attention on the mono-ortho-functionalized molecular structure, we have investigated the effect of the alkoxy chain length and nature on the reduction of dye-to-dye aggregation as well as on the enhancement of light harvesting capabilities, finding an almost linear relationship between the device photon conversion efficiency (PCE) and the alkoxy chain length both in the presence and in the absence of a co-disaggregating agent.",

However, when sensory input is impaired or absent, as in the case of various neuropathies or amputation, the ability to perform everyday tasks, like modulating grip force to object weight, can be affected. In this study, we show the results of a preliminary study using a pressure cuff-like force feedback device (CUFF) with the SoftHand Pro (SHP) prosthetic hand. Subjects lifted an object of various weights using their own hand, with the SHP without feedback, and the SHP with force feedback. As expected, significant differences were found between the two SHP conditions and the native hand, but surprisingly not between the SHP conditions. A closer look at the data suggests the feedback may help diminish the overall grip force used during grasping even if it does not alter the grip force modulation to object weight. The lack of significance may be due in part to high intra- and inter-subject variability. Additional training with the CUFF and/or customization of the feedback may enhance the effects and warrants further study.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 IEEE. Spatial-resolved light delivery in the living mammalian brain is of utmost importance in optogenetics experiments, since it allows for combining cell-type specificity with spatial selective optical control of neural activity. This can be achieved at sub-cellular resolution in first cortical layers with two-photon microscopy, while sub-cortical regions can be accessed by using waveguide-based devices. Tapered and nanostructured optical fibers have been recently proposed as viable devices to dynamically switch light stimuli between different points of deep-brain structures, by exploiting both mode division demultiplexing operated by the fiber taper and excitation of well-defined subsets of guided modes into the fiber [Pisanello et al., Neuron, vol. 82, p.1245 (2014); Pisanello et al., Biomed. Opt. Express, vol. 6, p. 4014 (2015)]. This latter is achieved byselecting the injection angle of a high-quality Gaussian beam, therefore exciting guided modes with defined transversal propagation constants. In this contribution we analyze the effectiveness of this technique as a function of the laser beam profile used to guide light into the fiber, complementing experimental results with ray tracing simulations. Two different commercial laser sources, with sensibly different beam qualities, were used to determine the extent of the injected modal subsets in a 0.22 N.A. optical fiber. This was obtained by measuring the transversal component kt of the wavevector through far-field imaging. We show that even poor quality beams might return satisfactory selection accuracy, provided that care is taken in the design of the coupling strategy.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 American Chemical Society.Cu2-xTe nanocubes were used as starting seeds to access metal telluride nanocrystals by cation exchanges at room temperature. The coordination number of the entering cations was found to play an important role in dictating the reaction pathways. The exchanges with tetrahedrally coordinated cations (i.e., with coordination number 4), such as Cd2+ or Hg2+, yielded monocrystalline CdTe or HgTe nanocrystals with Cu2-xTe/CdTe or Cu2-xTe/HgTe Janus-like heterostructures as intermediates. The formation of Janus-like architectures was attributed to the high diffusion rate of the relatively small tetrahedrally coordinated cations, which could rapidly diffuse in the Cu2-xTe NCs and nucleate the CdTe (or HgTe) phase in a preferred region of the host structure. Also, with both Cd2+ and Hg2+ ions the exchange led to wurtzite CdTe and HgTe phases rather than the more stable zinc-blende ones, indicating that the anion framework of the starting Cu2-xTe particles could be more easily deformed to match the anion framework of the metastable wurtzite structures. As hexagonal HgTe had never been reported to date, this represents another case of metastable new phases that can only be accessed by cation exchange. On the other hand, the exchanges involving octahedrally coordinated ions (i.e., with coordination number 6), such as Pb2+ or Sn2+, yielded rock-salt polycrystalline PbTe or SnTe nanocrystals with Cu2-xTe@PbTe or Cu2-xTe@SnTe core@shell architectures at the early stages of the exchange process. In this case, the octahedrally coordinated ions are probably too large to diffuse easily through the Cu2-xTe structure: their limited diffusion rate restricts their initial reaction to the surface of the nanocrystals, where cation exchange is initiated unselectively, leading to core@shell architectures. Interestingly, these heterostructures were found to be metastable as they evolved to stable Janus-like architectures if annealed at 200 °C under vacuum.",

Surface texturing, obtained by the use of fs-laser ultrashort pulses, has been demonstrated to induce a controlled periodicity of ripples of about 170 nm and length of several µm, able to drastically increase the diamond capability of interacting with solar radiation from its intrinsic visible blindness. Ultraviolet and visible Raman spectroscopy has been used to confirm the absence of non-diamond phases resulting from the process for the fs-laser-textured sample. Moreover, here we investigate the optical properties in the range 200 nm–25 µm. Absorbance of fs-laser-textured CVD diamond is considerably higher than the untreated one at every wavelength, resulting in a remarkable increase in the emittance: It points out the need for an optimization of process parameters to enhance the selective absorption capability.",

            "abstract": "Hedgehog (Hh) inhibitors have emerged as valid tools in the treatment of a wide range of cancers. Indeed, aberrant activation of the Hh pathway occurring either by ligand-dependent or -independent mechanisms is a key driver in tumorigenesis. The smoothened (Smo) receptor is one of the main upstream transducers of the Hh signaling and is a validated target for the development of anticancer compounds, as underlined by the FDA-approved Smo antagonist Vismodegib (GDC-0449/Erivedge) for the treatment of basal cell carcinoma. However, Smo mutations that confer constitutive activity and drug resistance have emerged during treatment with Vismodegib. For this reason, the development of new effective Hh inhibitors represents a major challenge for cancer therapy. Natural products have always represented a unique source of lead structures in drug discovery, and in recent years have been used to modulate the Hh pathway at multiple levels. Here, starting from an in house library of natural compounds and their derivatives, we discovered novel chemotypes of Hh inhibitors by mean of virtual screening against the crystallographic structure of Smo. Hh functional based assay identified the chalcone derivative 12 as the most effective Hh inhibitor within the test set. The chalcone 12 binds the Smo receptor and promotes the displacement of Bodipy-Cyclopamine in both Smo WT and drug-resistant Smo mutant. Our molecule stands as a promising Smo antagonist able to specifically impair the growth of Hh-dependent tumor cells in vitro and in vivo and medulloblastoma stem-like cells and potentially overcome the associated drug resistance.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 British Society for Neuroendocrinology The adipocyte-derived hormone leptin regulates appetite and energy homeostasis through the activation of leptin receptors (ObR) on hypothalamic neurones; hence, leptin must be transported through the blood–brain barrier (BBB) to reach its target sites in the central nervous system. During obesity, however, leptin BBB transport is decreased, in part precluding leptin as a viable clinical therapy against obesity. Although the short isoform of the ObR (ObRa) has been implicated in the transport of leptin across the BBB as a result of its elevated expression in cerebral microvessels, accumulating evidence indicates that leptin BBB transport is independent of ObRa. In the present study, we employed an ObR-neutralising antibody (9F8) to directly examine the involvement of endothelial ObR in leptin transport across an in vitro human BBB model composed of the human endothelial cell line hCMEC/D3. Our results indicate that, although leptin transport across the endothelial monolayer was nonparacellular, and energy- and endocytosis-dependent, it was not inhibited by pre-treatment with 9F8, despite the ability of the latter to recognise hCMEC/D3-expressed ObR, prevent leptin–ObR binding and inhibit leptin-induced signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT-3) phosphorylation in hCMEC/D3 cells. Furthermore, hCMEC/D3 cells expressed the transporter protein low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-2 (LRP-2), which is capable of binding and endocytosing leptin. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that leptin binding to and signalling through ObR is not required for efficient transport across human endothelial monolayers, indicating that ObR is not the primary leptin transporter at the human BBB, a role which may fall upon LRP-2. A deeper understanding of leptin BBB transport will help clarify the exact causes for leptin resistance seen in obesity and aid in the development of more efficient BBB-penetrating leptin analogues.",

Resistance to one such compound, ABT-737, is due to increased levels of anti-apoptotic MCL1. Using chemical and genetic approaches, we show that resistance to ABT-737 is abrogated by inhibition of the mitochondrial RING E3 ligase, MARCH5. Mechanistically, this is due to increased expression of pro-apoptotic BCL2 family member, NOXA, and is associated with MARCH5 regulation of MCL1 ubiquitylation and stability in a NOXA-dependent manner. MARCH5 expression contributed to an 8-gene signature that correlates with sensitivity to the preclinical BH3 mimetic, navitoclax. Furthermore, we observed a synthetic lethal interaction between MCL1 and MARCH5 in MCL1-dependent breast cancer cells. Our data uncover a novel level at which the BCL2 family is regulated; furthermore, they suggest targeting MARCH5-dependent signaling will be an effective strategy for treatment of BH3 mimetic-resistant tumors, even in the presence of high MCL1.",

            "abstract": "© 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. The apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1) is a protein central to the base excision DNA repair pathway and operates in the modulation of gene expression through redox-dependent and independent mechanisms. Aberrant expression and localization of APE1 in tumors are recurrent hallmarks of aggressiveness and resistance to therapy. We identified and characterized the molecular association between APE1 and nucleophosmin (NPM1), a multifunctional protein involved in the preservation of genome stability and rRNA maturation. This protein-protein interaction modulates subcellular localization and endonuclease activity of APE1. Moreover, we reported a correlation between APE1 and NPM1 expression levels in ovarian cancer, with NPM1 overexpression being a marker of poor prognosis. These observations suggest that tumors that display an augmented APE1/NPM1 association may exhibit increased aggressiveness and resistance. Therefore, targeting the APE1/NPM1 interaction might represent an innovative strategy for the development of anticancer drugs, as tumor cells relying on higher levels of APE1 and NPM1 for proliferation and survival may be more sensitive than untransformed cells. We set up a chemiluminescence-based high-throughput screening assay in order to find small molecules able to interfere with the APE1/NPM1 interaction. This screening led to the identification of a set of bioactive compounds that impair the APE1/NPM1 association in living cells. Interestingly, some of these molecules display anti-proliferative activity and sensitize cells to therapeutically relevant genotoxins. Given the prognostic significance of APE1 and NPM1, these compounds might prove effective in the treatment of tumors that show abundant levels of both proteins, such as ovarian or hepatic carcinomas.",

Up to cubic-order nonlinearities allow for an instantaneous estimation of the dynamic spectrum and bispectrum of the considered cardiovascular dynamics, as well as for instantaneous measures of complexity, through Lyapunov exponents and entropy. Short-term caress-like stimuli were administered for 4.3-25 seconds on the forearms of 32 healthy volunteers (16 females) through a wearable haptic device, by selectively superimposing two levels of force, 2 N and 6 N, and two levels of velocity, 9.4 mm/s and 65 mm/s.

            "abstract": "© 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co. KGaA, Weinheim In staggered thin film transistors, the injection length is the fraction of the gate to contact overlap that is effectively involved in current injection. Its assessment is important to properly downscale device dimensions. In fact, in order to increase transistor operation speed, the whole device footprint should be downscaled, which means both the gate to contact overlap and the channel length, as they affect the relative weight of gate to contact parasitic capacitances and the carrier transit time along the channel respectively. Nevertheless, it is not advisable to make the gate to contact overlap smaller than the injection length, because this negatively affects contact resistances. Suitable figures of merits are introduced to quantify these aspects, and a method is proposed to extract the injection length from electrical measurements. As an example of application, transistors based on the prototypical n-type polymer poly{[N,N′-bis(2-octyldodecyl)-naphthalene-1,4,5,8-bis(dicarboximide)-2,6-diyl]-alt-5,5′-(2,2′-bithiophene)} (P(NDI2OD-T2) are analyzed. When the channel length is scaled while driving voltages are kept constant, in P(NDI2OD-T2) the injection length decreases as well, thus proving that the downscaling of the whole device footprint is feasible. The physical origins of this finding are analyzed and traced back to material properties, in order to suggest general guidelines for a successful transistor downscaling.",

Here we report on the successful reduction of dark current below 100 nA cm−2 (at −1 V bias) in an inkjet printed photodetector by the insertion of an electron blocking layer based on poly[3-(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-methoxyphenyl)-thiophene], while preserving a high quantum yield. Furthermore, the electron blocking layer strongly increases the surface energy of the hydrophobic photoactive layer, therefore simplifying the printing of transparent top electrodes from water based formulations without the addition of surfactants.",

Many successful methods for nanoparticle synthesis are based on a comminution of the phases containing the precursors prior to the chemical reactions. The beneficial effects of such techniques are well-known in terms of small dimensions and narrow distributions of diameters of the nanoparticles thereby produced. According to specific methods, micelles or droplets behave as segregated micro-reactors where reactants are made to combine with minimization of further aggregation, to improve the quality of the final product. In the present paper, an aqueous solution of a reagent is nebulized on the surface of a stirred liquid containing the second reagent, with formation of a nanosized solid phase with diameter and height ranges of 50-100 nm and 6-8 nm, respectively. We are not aware of other wet-chemical methods based on such a technique, which proves to be simpler and more inexpensive than the typical one of traditional spray processes followed by high-temperature pyrolysis, which are generally carried out in flame reactors.",

During anodizing, the organic dye was incorporated into the porous oxide walls. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed the presence of nitrogen and sulfur in the anodic aluminumoxide. Two types of incorporated sulfur were found: belonging to the sulfate anions SO4 2- of the electrolyte and belonging to the C-SO3 - side groups of the indigo carmine. Raman spectroscopy confirmed the incorporation and showed that the inorganic-organic hybrid material inherited optical properties from the indigo carmine. Typical modes from pyrrolidone rings, unique for indigo carmine in the investigated system (650 and 1585 cm-1), were found to be the strongest for the greatest anodizing voltages used. Despite the indigo carmine incorporation, the morphology of the oxide is still nanoporous and its geometry is still tuned by the voltage applied during aluminum anodization.

Liquid environments are key to self-assembly since they allow suspended nanocrystals to diffuse and interact freely, but they also complicate experiments. Real-time observations with single-particle resolution could have transformative impact on our understanding of nanocrystal self-assembly. Here we use real-time in situ imaging by liquid-cell electron microscopy to elucidate the nucleation and growth mechanism and properties of linear chains of octapod-shaped nanocrystals in their native solution environment. Statistical mechanics modelling based on these observations and using the measured chain-length distribution clarifies the relative importance of dipolar and entropic forces in the assembly process and gives direct access to the interparticle interaction. Our results suggest that monomer-resolved in situ imaging combined with modelling can provide unprecedented quantitative insight into the microscopic processes and interactions that govern nanocrystal self-assembly in solution.",

A change in the complex permittivity of the metal film results in a change of the optical properties that depends on hydrogen concentration. Ellipsometry is the technique of choice to measure the optical constants prior and during hydrogenation. Sensors are then usually designed and optimized to measure changes in transmittance or reflectance of the palladium films. Films of different thicknesses have been realized and tested to verify potential applications in hydrogen sensing by studying the optical response prior, during and after hydrogenation, to assess in particular the reversibility of the process. Within this work a deep analysis carried out by X-ray reflectance (XRR) shows that during hydrogenation the films change also their thickness, and the amount has been assessed for a specific hydrogen concentration. Ellipsometric measurements have been therefore corrected taking into account such variation to determine the optical constants. Such structural property of the palladium hydride may be exploited in surface plasmon resonance transducers, which are sensitive also to the change of the sensing film thickness during detection.",

            "abstract": "Polymer nanocomposites have always attracted the interest of researchers and industry because of their potential combination of properties from both the nanofillers and the hosting matrix. Gathering nanomaterials and 3D printing could offer clear advantages and numerous new opportunities in several application fields. Embedding nanofillers in a polymeric matrix could improve the final material properties but usually the printing process gets more difficult. Considering this drawback, in this paper we propose a method to obtain polymer nanocomposites by in situ generation of nanoparticles after the printing process. 3D structures were fabricated through a Digital Light Processing (DLP) system by disolving metal salts in the starting liquid formulation. The 3D fabrication is followed by a thermal treatment in order to induce in situ generation of metal nanoparticles (NPs) in the polymer matrix.

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have deeply changed our understanding of cellular processes by delivering an astonishing amount of data at affordable prices; nowadays, many biology laboratories have already accumulated a large number of sequenced samples. However, managing and analyzing these data poses new challenges, which may easily be underestimated by research groups devoid of IT and quantitative skills. In this perspective, we identify five issues that should be carefully addressed by research groups approaching NGS technologies. In particular, the five key issues to be considered concern: (1) adopting a laboratory management system (LIMS) and safeguard the resulting raw data structure in downstream analyses; (2) monitoring the flow of the data and standardizing input and output directories and file names, even when multiple analysis protocols are used on the same data; (3) ensuring complete traceability of the analysis performed; (4) enabling non-experienced users to run analyses through a graphical user interface (GUI) acting as a front-end for the pipelines; (5) relying on standard metadata to annotate the datasets, and when possible using controlled vocabularies, ideally derived from biomedical ontologies. Finally, we discuss the currently available tools in the light of these issues, and we introduce HTS-flow, a new workflow management system conceived to address the concerns we raised. HTS-flow is able to retrieve information from a LIMS database, manages data analyses through a simple GUI, outputs data in standard locations and allows the complete traceability of datasets, accompanying metadata and analysis scripts.",

In this paper we experiment with DNN-HMM phone recognition systems that use measured articulatory information. Deep neural networks are both used to compute phone posterior probabilities and to perform acoustic-to-articulatory mapping (AAM). The AAM processes we propose are based on deep representations of the acoustic and the articulatory domains. Such representations allow to: (i) create different pre-training configurations of the DNNs that perform AAM; (ii) perform AAM on a transformed (through DNN autoencoders) articulatory feature (AF) space that captures strong statistical dependencies between articulators. Traditionally, neural networks that approximate the AAM are used to generate AFs that are appended to the observation vector of the speech recognition system. Here we also study a novel approach (AAM-based pretraining) where a DNN performing the AAM is instead used to pretrain the DNN that computes the phone posteriors. Evaluations on both the MOCHA-TIMIT msak0 and the mngu0 datasets show that: (i) the recovered AFs reduce phone error rate (PER) in both clean and noisy speech conditions, with a maximum 10.1% relative phone error reduction in clean speech conditions obtained when autoencoder-transformed AFs are used; (ii) AAM-based pretraining could be a viable strategy to exploit the available small articulatory datasets to improve acoustic models trained on large acoustic-only datasets.",

            "abstract": "© 2016, The Author(s). In this study, we investigated the integration of force and position information in a task in which participants were asked to estimate the center of a weak force field. Two hypotheses, describing how participants solved this task, were tested: (1) by only using the position(s) where the force reaches the detection threshold, and (2) by extrapolating the force field based on perceived stiffness. Both hypotheses were also described formally, assuming a psychophysical function obeying a power law with an exponent smaller than one. The hypotheses were tested in two psychophysical experiments, in which 12 participants took part. In Experiment 1, an asymmetric force field was used and the presence of visual feedback about hand position was varied. In Experiment 2, a unilateral force field was used. For both experiments, hypothesis 1 predicts biases between (Experiment 1) or at (Experiment 2) the position(s) of the force detection threshold, while hypothesis 2 predicts smaller biases. The measured data show significant biases in both experiments that coincide with the biases predicted by using force detection thresholds from the literature. The average measured responses and their variabilities also fitted very well with the mathematical model of hypothesis 1. These results underline the validity of hypothesis 1. So, participants did not use a percept of the stiffness of the force field, but based their estimation of the center of the force field on the position(s) where the force reached the detection threshold. This shows that force and position information were not integrated in this task.",

As novel, previously unimaginable neurotechnologies are emerging, what are the translational impact and the practical consequences carried by these tools for the clinical practice?

However, at present, they do not incorporate the supervision provided by a real therapist and do not allow safe and effective use at a patient's home. We show how specifically tailored computational intelligence based techniques allow extending exergames with functionalities that make rehabilitation at home effective and safe. The main function is in monitoring the correctness of motion, which is fundamental in avoiding developing wrong motion patterns, making rehabilitation more harmful than effective. Fuzzy systems enable us to capture the knowledge of the therapist and to provide real-time feedback of the patient's motion quality with a novel informative color coding applied to the patient's avatar. This feedback is complemented with a therapist avatar that, in extreme cases, explains the correct way to carry out the movements required by the exergames. The avatar also welcomes the patient and summarizes the therapy results to him/her. Text to speech and simple animation improve the engagement. Another important element is adaptation. Only the proper level of challenge exercises can be both effective and safe. For this reason exergames can be fully configured by therapists in terms of speed, range of motion, or accuracy. These parameters are then tuned during exercise to the patient's performance through a Bayesian framework that also takes into account input from the therapist. A log of all the interaction data is stored for clinicians to assess and tune the therapy, and to advise patients. All this functionality has been added to a classical game engine that is extended to embody a virtual therapist aimed at supervising the motion, which is the final goal of the exergames for rehabilitation. This approach can be of broad interest in the serious games domain. Preliminary results with patients and therapists suggest that the approach can maintain a proper challenge level while keeping the patient motivated, safe, and supervised.",

Here, we sought to highlight the molecular determinants of oligomer-membrane interaction by atomic force microscopy. We monitored the interaction between multiphase supported lipid bilayers and two types of HypF-N oligomers displaying different structural features and cytotoxicities. By our approach we imaged with unprecedented resolution the ordered and disordered lipid phases of the bilayer and different oligomer structures interacting with either phase. We identified the oligomers and lipids responsible for toxicity and, more generally, we established the importance of the membrane lipid component in mediating oligomer toxicity. Our findings support the importance of GM1 ganglioside in mediating the oligomer-bilayer interaction and support a mechanism of oligomer cytotoxicity involving bilayer destabilization by globular oligomers within GM1-rich ordered raft regions rather than by annular oligomers in the surrounding disordered membrane domains.",

The system is able to display haptically the height profile of a map, through a tactile mouse. Moreover, spatial auditory information is provided in the form of virtual anchor sounds located in specific points of the map, and delivered through headphones using customized Head-Related Transfer Functions (HRTFs). The validity of the proposed approach is investigated through two experiments on non-visual exploration of virtual maps. The first experiment has a preliminary nature and is aimed at assessing the effectiveness and the complementarity of auditory and haptic information in a goal reaching task. The second experiment investigates the potential of the system in providing subjects with spatial knowledge: specifically in helping with the construction of a cognitive map depicting simple geometrical objects. Results from both experiments show that the proposed concept, design, and implementation allow to effectively exploit the complementary natures of the \"proximal\" haptic modality and the \"distal\" auditory modality. Implications for orientation &amp; mobility (O&amp;M) protocols for visually impaired subjects are discussed.",

Here, we present a procedure of graphene functionalization on SiC(0001) that paves the way towards the fabrication of complex graphene electronic chips. The procedure resides on the well-known ion-implantation technique. The efficiency of the working principle is demonstrated by the intercalation of the epitaxial graphene layer on SiC(0001) with Bi atoms, which was not possible following standard procedures. The investigation of the obtained graphene system reveals no clear spin-orbit coupling enhancement expected by theory in addition to the presence of residual structural defects.

Edge modes can be deflected, branched, and mixed by designing a suitable potential landscape in a two-dimensional conducting system subject to a strong magnetic field. In the present work, we demonstrate a buried split-gate architecture and use it to control electron conduction in large-scale single-crystal monolayer graphene grown by chemical vapor deposition. The control of the edge trajectories is demonstrated by the observation of various fractional quantum resistances, as a result of a controllable interedge scattering. Experimental data are successfully modeled both numerically and analytically within the Landauer-Büttiker formalism. Our architecture is particularly promising and unique in view of the investigation of quantum transport via scanning probe microscopy, since graphene constitutes the topmost layer of the device. For this reason, it can be approached and perturbed by a scanning probe down to the limit of mechanical contact.",

Using an underlying continuous-time optimal control design, MIC uses models of the physical system to generate multivariate open-loop control signals between samples of the observed state. Using accurate model values of physical system parameters, stability of the closed loop system is not dependent upon sample interval. Here we consider the sensitivity of MIC to inaccurate model values of system parameters. The high dimensionality of multiple parameters combined with an unstable open loop system ensures the ratio of hyper-volumes containing good to bad parameter combinations resembles a 'needle in a haystack'. Is this sensitivity a problem or an asset? Prediction error between open loop and observed states provides the basis for triggering a sampling event but is also sensitive to inaccurate model values. Investigation of the mapping between prediction error and model values of physical parameters illustrates the value of prediction error to identify combinations of parameters giving stable closed loop control with low state error, similar to that provided by accurate values. Sensitivity of prediction error to model inaccuracy is potentially an asset facilitating adaptation and supporting the rationale for MIC to combine control with flexibility.",

In this paper, multitasking core-shell Fe3O4@Cu@Au superparamagnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) functionalised either with folic acid (FA) or methotrexate (MTX) have been used for engulfment of human granulocytes. MNPs internalisation into phagocytes allows to use the cells as carriers thus avoiding the rapid clearance and decreasing of concentration commonly experienced in case of in vivo nanoparticles administration. MNPs have been coated with poly-L-lysine (PLL), which contributes to improve their dispersion into polar solvents. Moreover, this coating improves the cellular uptake and allows the further functionalisation with MTX and FA. Experimental evidences of granulocytes engulfment have been obtained by both SEM and fluorescence microscopy, upon prior labelling of the lysines residues with suitable fluorescent probes. The superparamagnetic nature of the MNPs makes the system easily drivable into a specific tissue upon exposure to a defined magnetic field. The success of the internalisation experiments indicates that the system is a promising tool as theranostic agent for treatment of a variety of diseases, including tumours.",

Healthy and HFA participants observed point-light displays of two agents (A and B) performing separate actions. In the ‘communicative’ condition, the action performed by agent B responded to a communicative gesture performed by agent A. In the ‘individual’ condition, agent A’s communicative action was substituted by a non-communicative action. Using a simultaneous masking-detection task, we demonstrate that observing agent A’s communicative gesture enhanced visual discrimination of agent B for healthy controls, but not for participants with HFA. These results were not explained by differences in attentional factors as measured via eye-tracking, or by differences in the recognition of the point-light actions employed. Our findings, therefore, suggest that individuals with HFA are impaired in the use of social information to predict others’ actions and provide behavioural evidence that such deficits could be closely related to impairments of predictive coding.",

The innovation of the radio-guided surgery exploiting β- emitters is the higher tumor-to-non-tumor ratio (TNR) allowing both a smaller radiopharmaceutical absorbed dose to detect cancerous remnants and the possibility of extending the technique also to cases with a large uptake of surrounding healthy organs, as for brain tumors. Our first study cases are meningiomas, since an appropriate β- emitting drug is already available (90Y-DOTATOC), but the goal is to apply this technique to gliomas. We verified the uptake of the radiotracer in 8/10 patients affected by meningiomas with TNR ≥ 10 and in 9/12 patients with a TNR ≥ 4 in case of gliomas. We developed prototypes of an intraoperative probe detecting β- radiation. The core of the probe is a millimetric scintillator made of para-terphenyl due to its high light yield and low density. Tests in laboratory showed that with a radiotracer activity on the tumor of 5 kBq/ml and a TNR of 10 a 0.1 ml cancerous residual can be detected in 1s. That corresponds to administer to the patient 1 MBq/kg of radiopharmaceutical, which is a dose comparable to those administered for diagnostic use. Finally we estimated with a detailed simulation the exposure of the surgeon resulted in ∼0.1 Sv/h to the whole body and ∼1 Sv/h to the hands, well below the corresponding values for established RGS with gamma radiation.",

The development of the β- based radio-guided surgery aims to extend the technique to those tumours where surgery is the only possible treatment and the assessment of the resection would most profit from the low background around the lesion, as for brain tumours.

To validate the technique, a prototype of the intraoperative probe detecting β- decays and specific phantoms simulating tumour remnant patterns embedded in healthy tissue have been realized.

Compositional engineering of a mixed cation/mixed halide perovskite in the form of (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 is one of the most effective strategies to obtain record-efficiency perovskite solar cells. However, the perovskite self-organization upon crystallization and the final elemental distribution, which are paramount for device optimization, are still poorly understood. Here we map the nanoscale charge carrier and elemental distribution of mixed perovskite films yielding 20% efficient devices. Combining a novel in-house-developed high-resolution helium ion microscope coupled with a secondary ion mass spectrometer (HIM-SIMS) with Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM), we demonstrate that part of the mixed perovskite film intrinsically segregates into iodide-rich perovskite nanodomains on a length scale of up to a few hundred nanometers. Thus, the homogeneity of the film is disrupted, leading to a variation in the optical properties at the micrometer scale. Our results provide unprecedented understanding of the nanoscale perovskite composition.",

Intrinsic negative-mass dynamics is reported for light beams in a ferroelectric crystal substrate, where the diffusive photorefractive nonlinearity leads to a negative-mass Schrödinger equation.

For future application in next generation devices the accurate control over the properties of high-quality graphene synthesized on Ge surfaces, such as number of layers and domain size, is of paramount importance. Here we investigate the role of the process gas flows on the CVD growth of graphene on Ge(100). The quality and morphology of the deposited material is assessed by using μ-Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoemission spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and atomic force microscopy. We find that by simply varying the carbon precursor flow different growth regimes yielding to graphene nanoribbons, graphene monolayer, and graphene multilayer are established. We identify the growth conditions yielding to a layer-by-layer growth regime and report on the achievement of homogeneous monolayer graphene with an average intensity ratio of 2D and G bands in the Raman map larger than 3.",

Engineering optoelectronic devices for operation in liquid environments requires a comprehensive understanding of the consequences of exposing electrode materials to an aqueous environment. For this reason, we have investigated the stability of electrooptical properties (namely conductivity, work function, and transmittance) of several commonly used electrode materials for organic optoelectronics. As a potential means of improving the long-term performance of the electrodes in solution, we further characterized the stability of the electrodes following their deposition on a transparent SU-8 adhesion interlayer. As such, Indium-Tin Oxide, Gold, Gold-SU8, Silver, Silver-SU8, Aluminum, and Aluminium-SU8 were immersed in three different media of varying ionic composition (DI water, Phosphate-Buffered Saline and Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium) as well as a control 'air immersion' condition. By comparing the electrode materials side by side, we aimed to identify their advantages and drawbacks for use in solid/liquid devices, as well as the benefits of an adhesion layer for applications requiring long-term aqueous immersion. Our findings indicate that metals show severe delamination when deposited on glass, as indicated by decreased conductance and increased optical transmittance upon immersion in media. The use of an SU8 adhesion layer was effective in bonding Silver and Gold to enhance the film lifetime. Finally, since in many applications the electrode must make direct contact with biological species, we also investigated their biocompatibility by evaluating cytotoxicity of HEK293 cells cultured on the candidate materials, the results of which indicate positive biocompatibility profile for the materials investigated.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 The Author(s). Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic pathological condition that leads to neurodegeneration, loss of intellectual abilities, including cognition and memory, and ultimately to death. It is widely recognized that AD is a multifactorial disease, where different pathological cascades (mainly amyloid and tau) contribute to neural death and to the clinical outcome related to the disease. The currently available drugs for AD were developed according to the one-target, one-drug paradigm. In recent times, multi-target strategies have begun to play an increasingly central role in the discovery of more efficacious candidates for complex neurological conditions, including AD. In this study, we report on the in vivo pharmacological characterization of ARN14140, a new chemical entity, which was obtained through a multi-target structure-activity relationship campaign, and which showed a balanced inhibiting profile against the acetylcholinesterase enzyme and the NMDA receptor. Based on the initial promising biochemical data, ARN14140 is here studied in mice treated with the amyloidogenic fragment 25-35 of the amyloid-β peptide, a consolidated non-transgenic AD model. Sub-chronically treating animals with ARN14140 leads to a prevention of the cognitive impairment and of biomarker levels connected to neurodegeneration, demonstrating its neuroprotective potential as new AD agent.",

We report the first in vivo genetic screen of patient-derived tumors, using metastatic melanomas and targeting 236 chromatin genes by expression of specific shRNA libraries. Our screens revealed unprecedented numerosity of genes indispensable for tumor growth (∼ 50% of tested genes) and unexpected functional heterogeneity among patients (&lt;15% in common). Notably, these genes were not activated by somatic mutations in the same patients and are therefore distinguished from mutated cancer driver genes. We analyzed underlying molecular mechanisms of one of the identified genes, the Histone-lysine N-methyltransferase KMT2D, and showed that it promotes tumorigenesis by dysregulating a subset of transcriptional enhancers and target genes involved in cell migration. The assembly of enhancer genomic patterns by activated KMT2D was highly patient-specific, regardless of the identity of transcriptional targets, suggesting that KMT2D might be activated by distinct upstream signaling pathways. SIGNIFICANCE: Drug targeting of biologically relevant cancer-associated mutations is considered a critical strategy to control cancer growth. Our functional in vivo genetic screens of patient-derived tumors showed unprecedented numerosity and interpatient heterogeneity of genes that are essential for tumor growth, but not mutated, suggesting that multiple, patient-specific signaling pathways are activated in tumors.",

Contrast-enhanced ultrasound with targeted microbubble contrast agents is an emerging technique for imaging biological processes at the molecular level. The accumulation of targeted microbubbles at tissue sites overexpressing specific molecular markers increases the backscattered signal for noninvasive evaluations of diseases. The aim of this preliminary study was to combine molecular imaging with an in vivo contrast agent quantification to support the early diagnosis of the pathology and to enhance the assessment of neoplastic tissues. Tumor growth was induced by subcutaneous injection of prostate cancer cells in four rats. Microbubbles targeted to tissue factor (TF) were administered. A vascularized region located in proximity to the tumor and centered around the focus depth was analyzed in each animal. The backscattered signals (i.e. the radio-frequency data) were acquired during two different perfusion conditions to evaluate the contribution of attached microbubbles. After image generation by means of a multi-pulse contrast-enhanced technique, a nonlinear regression method based on the support vector machine was employed to estimate the contrast agent concentrations in cubic voxels (1-mm side length). The number of attached microbubbles per mm3 was estimated based on a multi-dimensional vector of features extracted from the processed radio-frequency signals. A significant correlation (p &lt; 0.05) between the size of the tumors and the estimated microbubble concentration was found, thus opening the possibility for combining molecular imaging and contrast agent concentration mapping to refine pathology evaluation.

We developed an unbiased and in vivo target discovery approach to identify molecular vulnerabilities in low-passage and patient-derived PDAC xenografts or genetically engineered mouse model-derived allografts. Focusing on epigenetic regulators, we identified WDR5, a core member of the COMPASS histone H3 Lys4 (H3K4) MLL (1–4) methyltransferase complex, as a top tumor maintenance hit required across multiple human and mouse tumors. Mechanistically, WDR5 functions to sustain proper execution of DNA replication in PDAC cells, as previously suggested by replication stress studies involving MLL1, and c-Myc, also found to interact with WDR5. We indeed demonstrate that interaction with c-Myc is critical for this function. By showing that ATR inhibition mimicked the effects of WDR5 suppression, these data provide rationale to test ATR and WDR5 inhibitors for activity in this disease.",

In the present study, we have fabricated a simple resistive switching device using a solution processable nanocomposite based on silver nitrate and poly(vinylidene fluoride-hexafluoropropylene). The change in resistance is ascribed to an initial ionic conduction, followed by a non-continuous field induced filament formation. The switching device fabricated with the above-mentioned active matrix displayed a volatile switching behavior. The addition of room temperature ionic liquid plays a fundamental role in triggering permanent memory and reducing the set voltage range up to ten-fold. The change in switching behavior with respect to the applied voltage bias and compliance level set during electrical characterization was studied thoroughly. The present work also gives a glimpse into the importance of device architecture on resistive switching phenomena.",

            "abstract": "© Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.This work addresses the question whether active impedance control is key to a breakthrough for legged robots. In this paper, we will talk about controlling the mechanical impedance of joints and legs with a focus on stiffness and damping control. In contrast to passive elements like springs, active impedance is achieved by torque-controlled joints allowing real-time adjustment of stiffness and damping. We argue that legged robots require a high degree of versatility and flexibility to execute a wide range of assistive tasks to be truly useful to humans and thus to lead to a breakthrough. Adjustable stiffness and damping in realtime is a fundamental building block towards versatility. Experiments with our 80 kg hydraulic quadruped robot HyQ demonstrate that active impedance alone (thus no springs in the structure) can successfully emulate passively compliant elements during highly-dynamic locomotion tasks (running and hopping); and, that no springs are needed to protect the actuation system. Here we present results of a flying trot, also referred to as running trot. To the authors’ best knowledge this is the first time a flying trot was successfully implemented on a robot without passive elements such as springs. A critical discussion on the pros and cons of active impedance concludes the paper. An extended version of this paper has been published in IJRR in 2015 [43].",

            "abstract": "© 2016 American Chemical Society. It is well known that a superhydrophobic surface may not be able to repel impacting droplets because of the so-called Cassie-to-Wenzel transition. It has been proven that a critical value of the receding contact angle (θR) exists for the complete rebound of water, recently experimentally measured to be 100° for a large range of impact velocities. On the contrary, in the present work, no rebound was observed when low-surface-tension liquids such as hexadecane (σ = 27.5 mN/m at 25 °C) are concerned, even for very low impact velocities and very high values of θR and low contact angle hysteresis. Therefore, the critical threshold of θR ≈ 100° does not sound acceptable for all liquids and for all hydrophobic surfaces. For the same Weber numbers, a Cassie-to-Wenzel state transition occurs after the impact as a result of the easier penetration of low-surface-tension fluids in the surface structure. Hence, a criterion for the drop rebound of low-surface-tension liquids must consider not only the contact angle values with surfaces but also their surface tension and viscosity. This suggests that, even if it is possible to produce surfaces with enhanced static repellence against oils and organics, generally the realization of synthetic materials with self-cleaning and antisticking abilities in dynamic phenomena, such as spray impact, remains an unsolved task. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the chemistry of the surface, the physicochemical interactions with the liquid drops, and the possible wettability gradient of the surface asperity also play important roles in determining the critical Weber number above which impalement occurs. Therefore, the classical numerical simulations of drop impact on dry surfaces are definitively not able to capture the final outcomes of the impact for all possible fluids if the surface topology and chemistry and/or the wettability gradient in the surface structure are not properly reflected.",

In the brain, EpoR has been shown to protect several neuronal cell types from cell death, including the A9 dopaminergic neurons (DA) of the Substantia Nigra (SN). These cells form the nigrostriatal pathway and are devoted to the control of postural reflexes and voluntary movements. Selective degeneration of A9 DA neurons leads to Parkinson's disease. By the use of nanoCAGE, a technology that allows the identification of Transcription Start Sites (TSSs) at a genome-wide level, we have described the promoter-level expression atlas of mouse A9 DA neurons purified with Laser Capture Microdissection (LCM). Here, we identify mRNA variants of the Erythropoietin Receptor (DA-EpoR) transcribed from alternative TSSs. Experimental validation and full-length cDNA cloning is integrated with gene expression analysis in the FANTOM5 database. In DA neurons, the EpoR gene encodes for a N-terminal truncated receptor. Based on STAT5 phosphorylation assays, we show that the new variant of N-terminally truncated EpoR acts as decoy when co-expressed with the full-length form. A similar isoform is also found in human. This work highlights new complexities in the regulation of Erythropoietin (EPO) signaling in the brain. (Figure presented.).",

            "abstract": "Â© 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht. In higher plants, photosystem II (PSII) is a multi-subunit pigment-protein complex embedded in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts, where it is present mostly in dimeric form within the grana. Its light-harvesting antenna system, LHCII, is composed of trimeric and monomeric complexes, which can associate in variable number with the dimeric PSII core complex in order to form different types of PSII-LHCII supercomplexes. Moreover, PSII-LHCII supercomplexes can laterally associate within the thylakoid membrane plane, thus forming higher molecular mass complexes, termed PSII-LHCII megacomplexes (Boekema et al. 1999a, in Biochemistry 38:2233–2239; Boekema et al. 1999b, in Eur J Biochem 266:444–452). In this study, pure PSII-LHCII megacomplexes were directly isolated from stacked pea thylakoid membranes by a rapid single-step solubilization, using the detergent n-dodecyl-α-d-maltoside, followed by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation. The megacomplexes were subjected to biochemical and structural analyses. Transmission electron microscopy on negatively stained samples, followed by single-particle analyses, revealed a novel form of PSII-LHCII megacomplexes, as compared to previous studies (Boekema et al.1999a, in Biochemistry 38:2233–2239; Boekema et al. 1999b, in Eur J Biochem 266:444–452), consisting of two PSII-LHCII supercomplexes sitting side-by-side in the membrane plane, sandwiched together with a second copy. This second copy of the megacomplex is most likely derived from the opposite membrane of a granal stack. Two predominant forms of intact sandwiched megacomplexes were observed and termed, according to (Dekker and Boekema 2005 Biochim Biophys Acta 1706:12–39), as (C2S2)4 and (C2S2Â +Â C2S2M2)2 megacomplexes. By applying a gel-based proteomic approach, the protein composition of the isolated megacomplexes was fully characterized. In summary, the new structural forms of isolated megacomplexes and the related modeling performed provide novel insights into how PSII-LHCII supercomplexes may bind to each other, not only in the membrane plane, but also between granal stacks within the chloroplast.",

The specific kinematics features employed by iT-Knee can accommodate not only the translational of the knee instantaneous center of rotation in the sagittal plane and on its orthogonal direction, but also the knee varus/valgus angle as well as the internal/external rotation tibia movements delivering pure torque only around the flexion/extension movement. This functionality results in superior transparency and comfortability which allow prolonged period of use without generating significant discomfort. The iT-Knee kinematics, its mechanism, implementation, and actuation are introduced. The Self-aligning feature combined with a fast lock/release mounting system on the human leg shortens the setup time required to wear it, increasing its user-friendly perception. iTKnee uses a torque controlled actuation unit to generate torque around the knee flexion extension enabling the implementation of several interaction control schemes that combine assistive functionality on demand with high back drivability and transparency during unloaded free motions of the human knee. Experimental results are presented and effectively demonstrate the functionality of the iT-Knee device.",

            "abstract": "Malignant gliomas are among the most frequent and aggressive cerebral tumors, characterized by high proliferative and invasive indexes. Standard therapy for patients, after surgery and radiotherapy, consists of temozolomide (TMZ), a methylating agent that blocks tumor cell proliferation. Currently, there are no therapies aimed at reducing tumor cell invasion. Ion channels are candidate molecular targets involved in glioma cell migration and infiltration into the brain parenchyma. In this paper we demonstrate that: i) blockade of the calcium-activated potassium channel KCa3.1 with TRAM-34 has co-adjuvant effects with TMZ, reducing GL261 glioma cell migration, invasion and colony forming activity, increasing apoptosis, and forcing cells to pass the G2/M cell cycle phase, likely through cdc2 de-phosphorylation; ii) KCa3.1 silencing potentiates the inhibitory effect of TMZ on glioma cell viability; iii) the combination of TMZ/TRAM-34 attenuates the toxic effects of glioma conditioned medium on neuronal cultures, through a microglia dependent mechanism since the effect is abolished by clodronate-induced microglia killing; iv) TMZ/TRAM-34 co-treatment increases the number of apoptotic tumor cells, and the mean survival time in a syngeneic mouse glioma model (C57BL6 mice implanted with GL261 cells); v) TMZ/TRAM-34 co-treatment reduces cell viability of GBM cells and cancer stem cells (CSC) freshly isolated from patients. Taken together, these data suggest a new therapeutic approach for malignant glioma, targeting both glioma cell proliferating and migration, and demonstrate that TMZ/TRAM-34 co-treatment affects both glioma cells and infiltrating microglia, resulting in an overall reduction of tumor cell progression.",

Among the strategies adopted by glioma to successfully invade the brain parenchyma is turning the infiltrating microglia/macrophages (M/MΦ) into allies, by shifting them toward an anti-inflammatory, pro-tumor phenotype. Both glioma and infiltrating M/MΦ cells express the Ca 2+ -activated K + channel (KCa3.1), and the inhibition of KCa3.1 activity on glioma cells reduces tumor infiltration in the healthy brain parenchyma. We wondered whether KCa3.1 inhibition could prevent the acquisition of a pro-tumor phenotype by M/MΦ cells, thus contributing to reduce glioma development. With this aim, we studied microglia cultured in glioma-conditioned medium or treated with IL-4, as well as M/MΦ cells acutely isolated from glioma-bearing mice and from human glioma biopsies. Under these different conditions, M/MΦ were always polarized toward an anti-inflammatory state, and preventing KCa3.1 activation by 1-(2-Chlorophenyl)diphenylmethyl-1H-pyrazole (TRAM-34), we observed a switch toward a pro-inflammatory, antitumor phenotype. We identified FAK and PI3K/AKT as the molecular mechanisms involved in this phenotype switch, activated in sequence after KCa3.1. Anti-inflammatory M/MΦ have higher expression levels of KCa3.1 mRNA (kcnn4) that are reduced by KCa3.1 inhibition. In line with these findings, TRAM-34 treatment, in vivo, significantly reduced the size of tumors in glioma-bearing mice. Our data indicate that KCa3.1 channels are involved in the inhibitory effects exerted by the glioma microenvironment on infiltrating M/MΦ, suggesting a possible role as therapeutic targets in glioma.",

Overexpression in humans of KCNH2-3.1, which encodes a primate-specific and brain-selective isoform of the human ether-a-go-go-related potassium channel, is associated with impaired cognition, inefficient neural processing and schizophrenia. Here, we describe a new mouse model that incorporates the KCNH2-3.1 molecular phenotype. KCNH2-3.1 transgenic mice are viable and display normal sensorimotor behaviors. However, they show alterations in neuronal structure and microcircuit function in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, areas affected in schizophrenia. Specifically, in slice preparations from the CA1 region of the hippocampus, KCNH2-3.1 transgenic mice have fewer mature dendrites and impaired theta burst stimulation long-term potentiation. Abnormal neuronal firing patterns characteristic of the fast deactivation kinetics of the KCNH2-3.1 isoform were also observed in prefrontal cortex. Transgenic mice showed significant deficits in a hippocampal-dependent object location task and a prefrontal cortex-dependent T-maze working memory task. Interestingly, the hippocampal-dependent alterations were not present in juvenile transgenic mice, suggesting a developmental trajectory to the phenotype. Suppressing KCNH2-3.1 expression in adult mice rescues both the behavioral and physiological phenotypes. These data provide insight into the mechanism of association of KCNH2-3.1 with variation in human cognition and neuronal physiology and may explain its role in schizophrenia.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 American Chemical Society. We propose a new QSRR model based on a Kernel-based partial least-squares method for predicting UPLC retention times in reversed phase mode. The model was built using a combination of classical (physicochemical and topological) and nonclassical (fingerprints) molecular descriptors of 1383 compounds, encompassing different chemical classes and structures and their accurately measured retention time values. Following a random splitting of the data set into a training and a test set, we tested the ability of the model to predict the retention time of all the compounds. The best predicted/experimental R2 value was higher than 0.86, while the best Q2 value we observed was close to 0.84. A comparison of our model with traditional and simpler MLR and PLS regression models shows that KPLS better performs in term of correlation (R2), prediction (Q2), and support to MetID peak assignment. The KPLS model succeeded in two real-life MetID tasks by correctly predicting elution order of Phase I metabolites, including isomeric monohydroxylated compounds. We also show in this paper that the model's predictive power can be extended to different gradient profiles, by simple mathematical extrapolation using a known equation, thus offering very broad flexibility. Moreover, the current study includes a deep investigation of different types of chemical descriptors used to build the structure-retention relationship.",

We introduce and test a nonlocal energy-optimized model kernel (NEO) within the adiabatic connection fluctuation-dissipation (ACFD) density-functional theory for the jellium surface and uniform electron gas, as benchmarks for simple metallic systems. Our model kernel is short ranged for the uniform electron gas paradigm system and one-electron self-correlation free. One-electron self-interaction freedom is provided by an iso-orbital indicator. We show how several versions of the NEO kernel perform for the uniform electron gas and jellium surface energies, and in addition we explain the underlying physics of self-interaction-free exchange-only kernels for exponentially decaying surface densities.",

In this paper we introduce a novel teleoperated surgical platform, which employs a commercial haptic device to convey information about the laser incision depth to the surgeon. The incision depth is estimated by a feed forward model that maps the laser parameters selected by the surgeon and the total time of laser exposure to the resulting ablation depth. An experiment was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed system in enabling precise laser ablation. The experiment involved ten human subjects who were asked to complete a single-point laser ablation task.

The binding of sulfonamides to human carbonic anhydrase II (hCAII) is a complex and long-debated example of protein-ligand recognition and interaction. In this study, we investigate the para-substituted n-alkyl and hydroxyethylene-benzenesulfonamides, providing a complete reconstruction of their binding pathway to hCAII by means of large-scale molecular dynamics simulations, density functional calculations, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) measurements, and X-ray crystallography experiments. Our analysis shows that the protein-ligand association rate (kon) dramatically increases with the ligands hydrophobicity, pointing to the existence of a prebinding stage largely stabilized by a favorable packing of the ligands apolar moieties with the hCAII \"hydrophobic wall\". The characterization of the binding pathway allows an unprecedented understanding of the structure-kinetic relationship in hCAII/benzenesulfonamide complexes, depicting a paradigmatic scenario for the multistep binding process in protein-ligand systems.",

We present the theory of semilocal exchange-correlation (XC) energy functionals which depend on the Kohn–Sham kinetic energy density (KED), including the relevant class of meta-generalized gradient approximation (meta-GGA) functionals. Thanks to the KED ingredient, meta-GGA functionals can satisfy different exact constraints for XC energy and can be made one-electron self-correlation free. This leads to a better accuracy over a wider range of properties with respect to GGAs, often reaching the accuracy of hybrid functionals, but at much reduced computational cost. An extensive survey of the relevant literature on existing KED dependent XC functionals is provided, considering nonempirical, semi-empirical, and fully empirical ones. A deeper analysis and a wide benchmark are presented for functionals derived considering only exact constraints and parameters obtained from model and/or atomic systems.",

Here we report the possibility to characterize human PBMC in their physiological conditions in a microfluidic-based measurement system. A viscoelastic polymer solution is adopted for 3D alignment of individual cells inflow. An optical signature (OS) acquisition of each flowing cell is performed using a wide angle light scattering apparatus. Besides, a quantitative phase imaging (QPI) holographic system is employed with the aim (i) to check the position in flow of individual cells using a holographic 3D cell tracking method; and (ii) to estimate their 3D morphometric features, such as their refractive index (RI). Results obtained by combining OS and QPI have been compared with literature values, showing good agreement. The results confirm the possibility to obtain sub-micrometric details of physical cell properties in microfluidic flow, avoiding chemical staining or fluorescent labelling.",

Carbohydrate-conjugated silicon(IV) phthalocyanines with bimodal photoactivity were developed as probes with both fluorescent labeling and photosensitizing capabilities, and the concomitant fluorescent labeling and photoinduced inactivation of Gram-positive and Gram-negative models was explored. The maltohexaose-conjugated photoprobe provides a dual readout to distinguish between both groups of pathogens, as only the Gram-positive species was inactivated, even though both appeared labeled with near-infrared luminescence. Antibiotic resistance did not hinder the phototoxic effect, as even the methicillin-resistant pathogen Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was completely photoinactivated. Time-resolved confocal fluorescence microscopy analysis suggests that the photoprobe sticks onto the outer rim of the microorganisms, explaining the resistance of Gram-negative species on the basis of their membrane constitution. The mannose-conjugated photoprobe yields a different readout because it is able to label and to inactivate only the Gram-positive strain.",

CDKL5 loss-of-function murine models recapitulate pathological signs of the human disease, such as visual attention deficits and reduced visual acuity. Here we investigated the cellular and synaptic substrates of visual defects by studying the organization of the primary visual cortex (V1) of Cdkl5-/y mice. We found a severe reduction of c-Fos expression in V1 of Cdkl5-/y mutants, suggesting circuit hypoactivity. Glutamatergic presynaptic structures were increased, but postsynaptic PSD-95 and Homer were significantly downregulated in CDKL5 mutants. Interneurons expressing parvalbumin, but not other types of interneuron, had a higher density in mutant V1, and were hyperconnected with pyramidal neurons. Finally, the developmental trajectory of pavalbumin-containing cells was also affected in Cdkl5-/y mice, as revealed by fainter appearance perineuronal nets at the closure of the critical period (CP). The present data reveal an overall disruption of V1 cellular and synaptic organization that may cause a shift in the excitation/inhibition balance likely to underlie the visual deficits characteristic of CDKL5 disorder. Moreover, ablation of CDKL5 is likely to tamper with the mechanisms underlying experience-dependent refinement of cortical circuits during the CP of development.",

A duplication of the human lamin B1 (LMNB1) gene has been linked to adult-onset autosomal dominant leukodystrophy, and mouse and human lossof-function mutations in lamin B1 are susceptibility factors for neural tube defects. In the mouse, experimental ablation of endogenous lamin B1 (Lmnb1) severely impairs embryonic corticogenesis. Here we report that in primary mouse cortical neurons, LMNB1 overexpression reduces axonal outgrowth, whereas deficiency of endogenous Lmnb1 results in aberrant dendritic development. In the absence of Lmnb1, both the length and complexity of dendrites are reduced, and their growth is unresponsive to KCl stimulation. This defective dendritic outgrowth stems from impaired ERK signaling. In Lmnb1-null neurons, ERK is correctly phosphorylated, but phospho-ERK fails to translocate to the nucleus, possibly due to delocalization of nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) at the nuclear envelope. Taken together, these data highlight a previously unrecognized role of lamin B1 in dendrite development of mouse cortical neurons through regulation of nuclear shuttling of specific signaling molecules and NPC distribution.",

Resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rsfMRI) of the human brain has revealed multiple large-scale neural networks within a hierarchical and complex structure of coordinated functional activity.

The study of macroscale intrinsic connectivity networks in preclinical species, where genetic and environmental conditions can be controlled and manipulated with high specificity, offers the opportunity to elucidate the biological determinants of these alterations. While rsfMRI methods are now widely used in human connectivity research, these approaches have only relatively recently been back-translated into laboratory animals. Here we review recent progress in the study of functional connectivity in rodent species, emphasising the ability of this approach to resolve large-scale brain networks that recapitulate neuroanatomical features of known functional systems in the human brain. These include, but are not limited to, a distributed set of regions identified in rats and mice that may represent a putative evolutionary precursor of the human default mode network (DMN). The impact and control of potential experimental and methodological confounds are also critically discussed. Finally, we highlight the enormous potential and some initial application of connectivity mapping in transgenic models as a tool to investigate the neuropathological underpinnings of the large-scale connectional alterations associated with human neuropsychiatric and neurological conditions. We conclude by discussing the translational potential of these methods in basic and applied neuroscience.",

            "abstract": "Deep CNN-based object detection systems have achieved remarkable success on several large-scale object detection benchmarks. However, training such detectors requires a large number of labeled bounding boxes, which are more difficult to obtain than image-level annotations. Previous work addresses this issue by transforming image-level classifiers into object detectors. This is done by modeling the differences between the two on categories with both imagelevel and bounding box annotations, and transferring this information to convert classifiers to detectors for categories without bounding box annotations. We improve this previous work by incorporating knowledge about object similarities from visual and semantic domains during the transfer process. The intuition behind our proposed method is that visually and semantically similar categories should exhibit more common transferable properties than dissimilar categories, e.g. a better detector would result by transforming the differences between a dog classifier and a dog detector onto the cat class, than would by transforming from the violin class. Experimental results on the challenging ILSVRC2013 detection dataset demonstrate that each of our proposed object similarity based knowledge transfer methods outperforms the baseline methods. We found strong evidence that visual similarity and semantic relatedness are complementary for the task, and when combined notably improve detection, achieving state-of-the-art detection performance in a semi-supervised setting.",

A possible solution to this challenging problem is presented in this paper, which proposes an automatic method based on anisotropic filtering and matched filter to extract the lesion area and segment blood vessels. Lesion classification is then performed based on a statistical analysis of the blood vessels' characteristics, such as thickness, tortuosity, and density. Here, the presented algorithm is applied to 50 NBI endoscopic images of laryngeal diseases and the segmentation and classification accuracies are investigated. The experimental results show the proposed algorithm provides reliable results, reaching an overall classification accuracy rating of 84.3%. This is a highly motivating preliminary result that proves the feasibility of the new method and supports the investment in further research and development to translate this study into clinical practice. Furthermore, to our best knowledge, this is the first time image processing is used to automatically classify laryngeal tumors in endoscopic videos based on tumor vascularization characteristics. Therefore, the introduced system represents an innovation in biomedical and health informatics.",

            "abstract": "© 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. Abstract: We present the localized in situ formation of Pd and Pt nanoparticles embedded in chitosan solid films. This is achieved by the photo-induced reduction of metallic precursors, previously incorporated in chitosan films, through controlled UV pulsed laser irradiation. Interestingly, at high number of laser pulses, Pd and Pt follow different formation pathways, contrary to their common photoreduction mechanism occurring at low irradiation pulses. Specifically, in the case of the Pd, a photofragmentation process takes place fracturing the previously formed nanoparticles into smaller ones; whereas in the case of Pt, the prolonged irradiation promotes the nanoparticles agglomeration. The combination of both precursors in a binary solid system results in the combined formation of both Pd and Pt nanoparticles in the polymer film upon laser irradiation. The herein reported approach is an efficient and precise tool to generate size- and density-controlled Pd and Pt nanoparticles in desired areas of polymeric films, rendering this method a potential candidate for the fabrication of flexible polymeric devices for gas-sensing or electro-catalysis applications.

Indeed, a tightly focused pulsed laser source permits complex tasks such as developing engineered bioscaffolds, applying calibrated forces, transfecting, stimulating, or even ablating single cells with subcellular precision, and operating intracellular surgical protocols at the level of single organelles.

An emerging challenge in kernel learning is the definition of similar deep representations. In this paper, we propose a general methodology to define a hierarchy of base kernels with increasing expressiveness and combine them via multiple kernel learning (MKL) with the aim to generate overall deeper kernels. As a leading example, this methodology is applied to learning the kernel in the space of Dot-Product Polynomials (DPPs), that is a positive combination of homogeneous polynomial kernels (HPKs). We show theoretical properties about the expressiveness of HPKs that make their combination empirically very effective. This can also be seen as learning the coefficients of the Maclaurin expansion of any definite positive dot product kernel thus making our proposed method generally applicable. We empirically show the merits of our approach comparing the effectiveness of the kernel generated by our method against baseline kernels (including homogeneous and non homogeneous polynomials, RBF, etc...) and against another hierarchical approach on several benchmark datasets.",

A common approach is to learn a similarly function which is a bilinear form associated to the pair of data points. We argue that this class may be too restrictive when handling heterogeneous datasets. To overcome this limitation local metric learning techniques have been advocated in the literature. However, they are subject to certain constraints preventing their usage in many applications. For example, they require knowledge of the class label of the training points. In this paper, we present a local metric learning method, which overcomes these limitations. The method first initializes a Gaussian mixture model on the training data. Then it estimates a set of local metrics and simultaneously refines the mixture's parameters. Finally, a similarity function is obtained by aggregating the local metrics. We also introduce a novel regularization term, which works well in a transfer learning setting. Our experiments show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on several real datasets.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 IEEE.Robots are becoming safe and smart enough to work alongside people not only on manufacturing production lines, but also in spaces such as houses, museums, or hospitals. This can be significantly exploited in situations in which a human needs the help of another person to perform a task, because a robot may take the role of the helper. In this sense, a human and the robotic assistant may cooperatively carry out a variety of tasks, therefore requiring the robot to communicate with the person, understand his/her needs, and behave accordingly. To achieve this, we propose a framework for a user to teach a robot collaborative skills from demonstrations. We mainly focus on tasks involving physical contact with the user, in which not only position, but also force sensing and compliance become highly relevant. Specifically, we present an approach that combines probabilistic learning, dynamical systems, and stiffness estimation to encode the robot behavior along the task. Our method allows a robot to learn not only trajectory following skills, but also impedance behaviors. To show the functionality and flexibility of our approach, two different testbeds are used: a transportation task and a collaborative table assembly.",

            "abstract": "© 1994-2011 IEEE. Morphological computation is a modern perspective on intelligence that gives the physical body a stronger role [1], [2]. With respect to the traditional view, in which behavior is the result of perception, processing, and movement, with morphological computation, behavior emerges from the complex interaction of the physical body with the environment and depends heavily on the mechanical properties, the shape (or the morphology), and the arrangement of perceptual, motor, and processing units [3]. In this view, according to [2], the material properties of the structures are extremely important for control. In fact, most living organisms have soft bodies. As summarized in [4], even animals with skeletons have soft tissues; in humans, for example, the skeleton typically contributes only 11% of the body mass of an adult male. Soft bodies thus appear to be fundamental to the emergence of behavior from the interaction with the environment. In other words, morphological computation benefits from soft bodies that react and adapt to such an interaction.",

The essential need for new lithium-ion battery materials providing higher energy and power densities has triggered an exceptional increase in scientific and industrial research efforts in recent years. Regarding the anode side, the two major research directions to achieve improved energy densities have, so far, focused on materials which can host lithium either by alloying or by a conversion mechanism. Very recently, however, a new class of potential next generation anodes is gaining continuously increasing attention: conversion/alloying materials. Herein, we provide for the first time a comprehensive review on this new materials' class. Initially, we discuss the two possible approaches to realize a combined conversion and alloying mechanism in a single compound, starting either from pure conversion or pure alloying materials. Based on this overview we subsequently highlight the fundamental insights and their potential advantages, which shall provide scientists with some general considerations and principles for the development of new, further enhanced conversion/alloying materials.",

Four Lhca subunits are tightly bound to the photosystem I (PSI) core complex, forming its outer antenna moiety called LHCI. The Arabidopsis thaliana mutant δLhca lacks all Lhca1-4 subunits and compensates for its decreased antenna size by binding LHCII trimers, the main constituent of the photosystem II antenna system, to PSI. In this work we have investigated the effect of LHCI/LHCII substitution by comparing the light harvesting and excitation energy transfer efficiency properties of PSI complexes isolated from δLhca mutants and from the wild type, as well as the consequences for plant growth. We show that the excitation energy transfer efficiency was not compromised by the substitution of LHCI with LHCII but a significant reduction in the absorption cross-section was observed. The absence of LHCI subunits in PSI thus significantly limits light harvesting, even on LHCII binding, inducing, as a consequence, a strong reduction in growth.",

Although the underlying physics is still under debate, athermal photofluidization has been demonstrated to trigger mass-migration according to the polarization of a proper illumination light. Here, a polymer blend is proposed wherein a commercial azo-polyelectrolyte is mixed with a passive polymer. The blend is patterned as an array of micro-pillars that are individually exposed to visible laser illumination. Thanks to the interplay between the two blend components, a reversible and controlled deformation of the micro-pillars by periodically tuning the laser polarization in time is demonstrated. A reduced mobility of the azo-compound allows to repeatibly elongate and rotate micro-pillars along specific directions, with no significant material flow outisde the initial volume and no significant degradation of the structure morphology over several cycles. The proposed work suggests new degrees of freedom in controlling the mechanical features of micro-patterned light-responsive materials that can be usefully exploited in many application fields.",

While neuronal excitation has been achieved with many tools, including electrical and optical stimulation, hyperpolarization and neuronal inhibition are typically obtained through patch-clamp or optogenetic manipulations. Here we report the use of conjugated polymer films interfaced with neurons for inducing a light-mediated inhibition of their electrical activity. We show that prolonged illumination of the interface triggers a sustained hyperpolarization of the neuronal membrane that significantly reduces both spontaneous and evoked action potential firing. We demonstrate that the polymeric interface can be activated by either visible or infrared light and is capable of modulating neuronal activity in brain slices and explanted retinas. These findings prove the ability of conjugated polymers to tune neuronal firing and suggest their potential application for the in-vivo modulation of neuronal activity.",

In spite of the unprecedented advances of organohalide lead perovskites in optoelectronic devices, many of the characteristics of this class of materials remain poorly understood. Several experimental hints point to defect migration as a plausible mechanism underlying such anomalous properties. Here we present an experimental and theoretical investigation combining measurements of PL rise dynamics at varying temperatures with first principles computational modeling of defect migration under light irradiation. We propose a model in which light irradiation promotes the annihilation of VI +/Ii - Frenkel pairs, which we show to be relatively abundant in polycrystalline MAPbI3. This partly restores a non-defective crystalline environment and eliminates the trapping centers associated with such defect pairs. The PL rise time dynamics at varying temperature provide an activation energy consistent with that calculated for migration of iodine defects, supporting the proposed model. We further illustrate a synergistic effect of ion/defect migration and lattice dynamics, with local reorientation of the methylammonium cations assisting the migration of charged defects. Our results provide the interpretative basis for further investigating the unusual light-induced modifications characterizing organohalide perovskites.",

Globoid cell leukodystrophy (GLD) is a rare, rapidly progressing childhood leukodystrophy triggered by deficit of the lysosomal enzyme galactosylceramidase (GALC) and characterized by the accumulation of galactosylsphingosine (psychosine; PSY) in the nervous system. PSY is a cytotoxic sphingolipid, which leads to widespread degeneration of oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells, causing demyelination. Here we report on autophagy in the human oligodendrocyte cell line MO3.13 treated with PSY and exploitation of Li as an autophagy modulator to rescue cell viability. We demonstrate that PSY causes upregulation of the autophagic flux at the level of autophagosome and autolysosome formation and LC3-II expression. We show that pretreatment with Li, a drug clinically used to treat bipolar disorders, can further stimulate autophagy, improving cell tolerance to PSY. This Li protective effect is found not to be linked to reduction of PSY-induced oxidative stress and might not stem from a reduction of PSY accumulation. These data provide novel information on the intracellular pathways activated during PSY-induced toxicity and suggest the autophagy pathway as a promising novel therapeutic target for ameliorating the GLD phenotype. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Photonic crystals and cavities are good candidates but do not tackle how to effectively address a nanoscale emitter. Using a nanowire nanowaveguide, we realise an hybrid nanodevice which locally excites a single photon source (SPS). The nanowire acts as a passive or active sub-wavelength waveguide to excite the quantum emitter. Our results show that localised excitation of a SPS is possible and is compared with free-space excitation. Our proof of principle experiment presents an absolute addressing efficiency ηa ∼ 10-4 only ∼50% lower than the one using free-space optics. This important step demonstrates that sufficient guided light in a nanowaveguide made of a semiconductor nanowire is achievable to excite a single photon source. We accomplish a hybrid system offering great potentials for electrically driven SPSs and efficient single photon collection and detection, opening the way for optimum absorption/emission of nanoscale emitters.

In Ce L3-edge XAS, a mixed valence of Ce was found in the x=0.0 sample, and F doping suppressed it, which is consistent with the results on polycrystalline samples. As for resonant PES, we found that the Ce 4f electrons in both x=0.0 and 0.5 systems respectively formed a flat band at 1.0 and 1.4 eV below the Fermi level and there was no contribution to the Fermi surfaces. Interestingly, Ce valence in CeOBiS2 deviates from Ce3+ even though Ce 4f electrons are localized, indicating the Ce valence is not in a typical valence fluctuation regime. We assume that localized Ce 4f in CeOBiS2 is mixed with unoccupied Bi 6pz, which is consistent with a previous local structural study. Based on the analysis of the Ce L3-edge XAS spectra using Anderson's impurity model calculation, we found that the transfer integral becomes smaller, increasing the number of Ce 4f electrons upon the F substitution for O.",

In recent years, actuation technology have been increasingly developed new fields and utilized widely in applications differing from automation and industry , but also robotic rehabilitation, haptics and wearable exoskeleton devices where safety, limitation of peak forces and gentle interaction are extremely important. To date, several examples of robotic applications have been designed to address the demanding needs of these disciplines that require the compliance in actuation and manipulation. However, the control performance is still limited due to lack of accuracy in robotic dynamics model and unmodeled nonlinearities such as friction. In such cases, estimating inverse dynamic model from collected data will provide an interesting alternative solution in order to achieve the compliance interaction and the good performance in position tracking. In this paper, an algorithm for online robotic inverse dynamics learning is proposed and explained using localization approach combined with Extreme Learning Machine.",

After performing a within-subject naive search task using a head-mounted vibrotactile display, we found that increasing the density of the array locally provides higher performance in detecting directional cues.",

A mixed consortium from seawater was used as inoculum and acetate was used as substrate. Tests were conducted for four months under 1000 Ω external load. The maximum power generation was obtained by C-SADDLES (102 mW m−2) followed by C-FELT and C-PANI, respectively. A similar trend was obtained with the evaluation of electrical energy produced: C-SADDLES (2222 J), C-PANI (2183 J) and C-FELT (2114 J). However, the performance of C-PANI decreased over time, most evidently due to degradation or deactivation of deposited polyaniline by the microorganisms’ activity. These results provide evidence that the three-dimensional structure, C-SADDLES, offers excellent biocompatibility, high specific surface area, high conductivity and most importantly these properties are maintained for a long period of time.",

To this end, trifluoroacetic acid was used as a common solvent for all of the involved biomaterials, achieving highly homogeneous blends that were suitable for the electrospinning technique. Morphological analysis revealed that the electrospun composite nanofibers were well-defined and defect-free, with a diameter in the range of 65-100 nm. Mechanical investigations demonstrated that the fibrous mats exhibited an increased stiffness when pure fibroin was combined with cellulose, whereas they possessed an increased flexibility when the parsley waste was added to fibroin. Lastly, the produced mats were highly biocompatible, as demonstrated by the promoted proliferation of fibroblast cells. The characteristics of the hybrid fibroin-cellulose nanofibers, in terms of nanoscale topography, mechanical properties, and biocompatibility, are attractive and potentially applicable in the biomedical sector.",

At acceleration voltages below 300 V, it delivers some ten ions per bunch with a relative energy spread ΔUrms/U≃0.032, as measured through the retarding field-energy-analyzer approach. Space-charge effects are negligible thanks to the low ion density attained in the interaction volume. The performances of the ion beam in a configuration using focused laser beams are extrapolated on the basis of the experimental results. Calculations demonstrate that our low-energy and low-current ion beam can be attractive for the development of emerging technologies requiring the delivery of a small amount of charge, down to the single-ion level and its eventual focusing in the 10-nm range.",

Comparison with a hydrophobic BODIPY derivative with very similar structure but deprived of the hydrophilic groups, clarifies the effects of functionalization. The changes in solution are studied at different levels of modeling. In particular, we make use of Car–Parrinello molecular dynamics to take thermal motion into account, by generating a set of molecular configurations at about room temperature and embedding them in the polarizable continuum model (PCM) for the solvent. The theoretical scheme is that of time-dependent density functional theory which we apply using different approximations for the exchange-correlation functionals. Changes in the low-lying excitation spectrum (≈2.5–4.5 eV) of the solvated molecule in water relative to gas phase are shown to be due not only to the electrostatic interaction with the solvent but also to the thermal motion that induces a downward energy shift and broadening of the absorption lines. Addition of explicit water molecules to the PCM only affects spectral features at higher energies.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 Melloni et al. Background: The increasing availability of resequencing data has led to a better understanding of the most important genes in cancer development. Nevertheless, the mutational landscape of many tumor types is heterogeneous and encompasses a long tail of potential driver genes that are systematically excluded by currently available methods due to the low frequency of their mutations. We developed LowMACA (Low frequency Mutations Analysis via Consensus Alignment), a method that combines the mutations of various proteins sharing the same functional domains to identify conserved residues that harbor clustered mutations in multiple sequence alignments. LowMACA is designed to visualize and statistically assess potential driver genes through the identification of their mutational hotspots. Results: We analyzed the Ras superfamily exploiting the known driver mutations of the trio K-N-HRAS, identifying new putative driver mutations and genes belonging to less known members of the Rho, Rab and Rheb subfamilies. Furthermore, we applied the same concept to a list of known and candidate driver genes, and observed that low confidence genes show similar patterns of mutation compared to high confidence genes of the same protein family. Conclusions: LowMACA is a software for the identification of gain-of-function mutations in putative oncogenic families, increasing the amount of information on functional domains and their possible role in cancer. In this context LowMACA emphasizes the role of genes mutated at low frequency otherwise undetectable by classical single gene analysis.

Atomic layer deposition (ALD) represents one of the most fundamental techniques capable of satisfying the strict technological requirements imposed by the rapidly evolving electronic components industry. The actual scaling trend is rapidly leading to the fabrication of nanoscaled devices able to overcome limits of the present microelectronic technology, of which the memristor is one of the principal candidates. Since their development in 2008, TiO2thin film memristors have been identified as the future technology for resistive random access memories because of their numerous advantages in producing dense, low power-consuming, three-dimensional memory stacks. The typical features of ALD, such as self-limiting and conformal deposition without line-of-sight requirements, are strong assets for fabricating these nanosized devices. This work focuses on the realization of memristors based on low-temperature ALD TiO2thin films. In this process, the oxide layer was directly grown on a polymeric photoresist, thus simplifying the fabrication procedure with a direct liftoff patterning instead of a complex dry etching process. The TiO2thin films deposited in a temperature range of 120-230 °C were characterized via Raman spectroscopy and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and electrical current-voltage measurements taken in voltage sweep mode were employed to confirm the existence of resistive switching behaviors typical of memristors. These measurements showed that these low-temperature devices exhibit an ON/OFF ratio comparable to that of a high-temperature memristor, thus exhibiting similar performances with respect to memory applications.",

            "abstract": "© 2016, Tsinghua University Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is typically used for large-scale graphene synthesis for practical applications. However, the inferior electronic properties of CVD graphene are one of the key problems to be solved. Therefore, we present a detailed study on the electronic properties of high-quality single-crystal monolayer graphene. The graphene is grown via CVD on copper, by using a cold-wall reactor, and then transferred to Si/SiO2. Our low-temperature magneto-transport data demonstrate that the characteristics of the single-crystal CVD graphene samples are superior to those of polycrystalline graphene and have a quality which is comparable to that of exfoliated graphene on Si/SiO2. The Dirac point in our best samples occurs at back-gate voltages lower than 10 V, and a maximum mobility of 11,000 cm2/(V·s) is attained. More than 12 flat and discernible half-integer quantum Hall plateaus occur under a high magnetic field on both the electron and hole sides of the Dirac point. At a low magnetic field, the magnetoresistance exhibits a weak localization peak. Using the theory of McCann et al., we obtain inelastic scattering lengths of &gt;1 µm, even at the charge neutrality point of the samples. [Figure not available: see fulltext.]",

When using rhodamine 6G dissolved in ethanol at concentration of 5·10-3 mol/l, laser emission was detected at a threshold energy density of 1.8 μJ/mm2 at least one order of magnitude lower than state-of-the-art optofluidic lasers.

            "abstract": "© 2015 Taylor and Francis. Macrophages are multi-faceted phagocytic effector cells that derive from circulating monocytes and undergo differentiation in target tissues to regulate key aspects of the inflammatory process. Macrophages produce and degrade a variety of lipid mediators that stimulate or suppress pain and inflammation. Among the analgesic and anti-inflammatory lipids released from these cells are the fatty acid ethanolamides (FAEs), which produce their effects by engaging nuclear peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-α (PPAR-α). Two members of this lipid family, palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) and oleoylethanolamide (OEA), have recently emerged as important intrinsic regulators of nociception and inflammation. These substances are released from the membrane precursor, N-acylphosphatidylethanolamine (NAPE), by the action of a NAPE-specific phospholipase D (NAPE-PLD), and in macrophage are primarily deactivated by the lysosomal cysteine amidase, N-acylethanolamine acid amidase (NAAA). NAPE-PLD and NAAA regulate FAE levels, exerting a tight control over the ability of these lipid mediators to recruit PPAR-α and attenuate the inflammatory response. This review summarizes recent findings on the contribution of the FAE-PPAR-α signaling complex in inflammation, and on NAAA inhibition as a novel mechanistic approach to treat chronic inflammatory disorders.",

However, the effectiveness of CAs is strictly related to both the solution adopted to merge the two agents into a single probe unit, and the ratio between the two agents. In this study, two dual-mode CAs for simultaneous magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound imaging (UI) were assessed. For this purpose, different densities of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) were anchored to the external surface of polymer-shelled microbubbles (MBs) or were physically entrapped into the shell. In vitro static and dynamic experiments were carried out with a limited concentration of modified MBs (106 bubbles ml−1) by avoiding destruction during UI (performed at a peak pressure lower than 320 kPa) and by using a lowfield MRI system (with a magnetic flux density equal to 0.25 T). Under these conditions, different imaging techniques, set-up parameters and SPION densities were used to achieve satisfactory detection of the CAs by using both UI and MRI. However, when the SPION density was increased, the MRI contrast improved, whereas the UI contrast worsened due to the reduced elasticity of the MB shell. For both UI and MRI, MBs with externally anchored SPIONs provided better performance than MBs with SPIONs entrapped into the shell. In particular, a SPION density of 29% with respect to the mass of the MBs was successfully tested.",

Purpose: To assess the correlation between functional MRI, including ADC values obtained from DWI and DCE, and clinical outcome in patients with bone metastases treated with MRgFUS. Methods and materials: Twenty-three patients with symptomatic bone metastases underwent MRgFUS treatment (ExAblate 2100 system InSightec) for pain palliation. All patients underwent clinical and imaging follow-up examinations at 1, 3 and 6 months after treatment. Visual Analog Scale (VAS) score was used to evaluate treatment efficacy in terms of pain palliation while ADC maps obtained by DWI sequences, and DCE data were used for quantitative assessment of treatment response at imaging. Spearman Correlation Coefficient Test was calculated to assess the correlation between VAS, ADC and DCE data. Results: All treatments were performed successfully without adverse events. On the basis of VAS score, 16 (69.6 %) patients were classified as complete clinical responders, 6 (26.1 %) as partial responders and only one (4.3 %) was classified as a non-responder. The mean VAS score decreased from 7.09 ± 1.8 at baseline to 2.65 ± 1.36 at 1 month, 1.04 ± 1.91 at 3 months and 1.09 ± 1.99 at 6 months (p &lt; 0.001). Baseline mean ADC value of treated lesions was 1.05 ± 0.15 mm2/s, increasing along follow-up period (1.57 ± 0.27 mm2/s 1st month; 1.49 ± 0.3 mm2/s 3rd month; 1.45 ± 0.32 mm2/s 6th month, p &lt; 0.001). Non perfused volume (NPV) was 46.4 at 1 month, 45.2 at 3 months and 43.8 at 6 months. Spearman Coefficient demonstrated a statistically significant negative correlation between VAS and ADC values (ρ = −0.684; p = 0.03), but no significant correlation between VAS and NPV (ρ = 0.02216, p = 0.9305). Among other DCE data, Ktrans significantly changed in complete responders (3 months Ktrans = 2.14/min; −ΔKt = 52.65 % p &lt; 0.01) and was not significantly different in partial responders (3 months Ktrans 0.042/min; ΔKt = 11.39 % p &gt; 0.01). Conclusion: In patients with painful bone metastases treated with MRgFUS, ADC and Ktrans variation observed in the ablated lesions correlate with VAS values and may play a role as objective imaging marker of treatment response.",

The 3d manifold of Fe in the half-filled configuration naturally favors an antiferromagnetic ordering, with a theoretical estimate of the antiferromagnetic Néel temperature in good agreement with the experimental values. We find that the inversion symmetry breaking is driven by the off-centering of Sc atoms, which results in a large ferroelectric polarization of ∼105 μC/cm2. Surprisingly the ferroelectric polarization is sensitive to the local magnetization of the Fe atoms resulting in a large negative magnetoelectric interaction. This behavior is unexpected in type-I multiferroic materials because the magnetic and ferroelectric orders are of different origins.",

The inclusion in cholesterol-enriched membrane domains is crucial for SERT activity, suggesting a cross-talk between the protein and the sterol. Here, we develop a protocol to identify potential cholesterol interaction sites coupling statistical analysis to multi-microsecond coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of SERT in a previously validated raft-like membrane model. Six putative sites were found, including a putative CRAC motif on TM4 and a CARC motif on TM10. Among them, four hot-spots near regions related to ion binding, transport, and inhibition were detected. Our results encourage prospective studies to unravel mechanistic features of the transporter and related drug discovery implications.",

Infrared (IR) nanospectroscopy performed in conjunction with atomic force microscopy (AFM) is a novel, label-free spectroscopic technique that meets the increasing request for nano-imaging tools with chemical specificity in the field of life sciences. In the novel resonant version of AFM-IR, a mid-IR wavelength-tunable quantum cascade laser illuminates the sample below an AFM tip working in contact mode, and the repetition rate of the mid-IR pulses matches the cantilever mechanical resonance frequency. The AFM-IR signal is the amplitude of the cantilever oscillations driven by the thermal expansion of the sample after absorption of mid-IR radiation. Using purposely nanofabricated polymer samples, here we demonstrate that the AFM-IR signal increases linearly with the sample thickness t for t &gt; 50 nm, as expected from the thermal expansion model of the sample volume below the AFM tip. We then show the capability of the apparatus to derive information on the protein distribution in single cells through mapping of the AFM-IR signal related to the amide-I mid-IR absorption band at 1660 cm-1. In Escherichia Coli bacteria we see how the topography changes, observed when the cell hosts a protein over-expression plasmid, are correlated with the amide I signal intensity. In human HeLa cells we obtain evidence that the protein distribution in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus is uneven, with a lateral resolution better than 100 nm.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 Elsevier B.V. Background Altered intrinsic function of the brain has been implicated in Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). Nonetheless, imaging studies have yielded inconsistent alterations of brain function. To investigate the neural activity at rest in BPD, we conducted a set of meta-analyses of brain imaging studies performed at rest. Methods A total of seven functional imaging studies (152 patients with BPD and 147 control subjects) were combined using whole-brain Signed Differential Mapping meta-analyses. Furthermore, two conjunction meta-analyses of neural activity at rest were also performed: with neural activity changes during emotional processing, and with structural differences, respectively. Results We found altered neural activity in the regions of the default mode network (DMN) in BPD. Within the regions of the midline core DMN, patients with BPD showed greater activity in the anterior as well as in the posterior midline hubs relative to controls. Conversely, in the regions of the dorsal DMN they showed reduced activity compared to controls in the right lateral temporal complex and bilaterally in the orbitofrontal cortex. Increased activity in the precuneus was observed both at rest and during emotional processing. Reduced neural activity at rest in lateral temporal complex was associated with smaller volume of this area. Limitations Heterogeneity across imaging studies. Conclusions Altered activity in the regions of the midline core as well as of the dorsal subsystem of the DMN may reflect difficulties with interpersonal and affective regulation in BPD. These findings suggest that changes in spontaneous neural activity could underlie core symptoms in BPD.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. DC magnetron sputtering is a commonly used technique for the fabrication of silicon based electronic devices, since it provides high deposition rates and uniform large area metallization. However, in addition to the thickness uniformity, coating optical uniformity is a crucial need for semiconductor industrial processes, due to the wide use of optical recognition tools. In the silicon-based technology, aluminum is one of the most used materials for the metal contact. Both the pre-deposition substrate cleaning and the sputtering conditions determine the quality and the crystalline properties of the final Al deposited film. In this paper is shown that not all the mentioned conditions lead to good quality and uniform Al films. In particular, it is shown that under certain standard process conditions, Al/Si alloy (1% Si) metallization on a [100] Si presents a non-uniform reflectivity, with a marbled texture caused by flakes with milky appearance. This optical inhomogeneity is found to be caused by the coexistence of randomly orient Al/Si crystal, with heteroepitaxial Al/Si crystals, both grown on Si substrate. Based on the microstructural analysis, some strategies to mitigate or suppress this marbled texture of the Al thin film are proposed and discussed.",

Here, we propose stem-cell spheroids as a tissue model to track intracellular magnetic nanoparticle transformations during long-term tissue maturation. We show that global spheroid magnetism can serve as a fingerprint of the degradation process, and we evidence a near-complete nanoparticle degradation over a month of tissue maturation, as confirmed by electron microscopy. Remarkably, the same massive degradation was measured at the endosome level by single-endosome nanomagnetophoretic tracking in cell-free endosomal extract. Interestingly, this spectacular nanoparticle breakdown barely affected iron homeostasis: only the genes coding for ferritin light chain (iron loading) and ferroportin (iron export) were up-regulated 2-fold by the degradation process. Besides, the magnetic and tissular tools developed here allow screening of the biostability of magnetic nanomaterials, as demonstrated with iron oxide nanocubes and nanodimers. Hence, stem-cell spheroids and purified endosomes are suitable models needed to monitor nanoparticle degradation in conjunction with magnetic, chemical, and biological characterizations at the cellular scale, quantitatively, in the long term, in situ, and in real time.",

Aberrant histone post-translational modifications (hPTMs) have been implicated with various pathologies, including cancer, and may represent useful epigenetic biomarkers. The data described here provide a mass spectrometry-based quantitative analysis of hPTMs from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues, from which histones were extracted through the recently developed PAT-H-MS method. First, we analyzed FFPE samples from mouse spleen and liver or human breast cancer up to six years old, together with their corresponding fresh frozen tissue. We then combined the PAT-H-MS approach with a histone-focused version of the super-SILAC strategy-using a mix of histones from four breast cancer cell lines as a spike-in standard- to accurately quantify hPTMs from breast cancer specimens belonging to different subtypes. The data, which are associated with a recent publication (Pathology tissue-quantitative mass spectrometry analysis to profile histone post-translational modification patterns in patient samples (Noberini, 2015) [1]), are deposited at the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository with the dataset identifier PXD002669.",

The positional relation of the InAs NWs with the graphene substrate was determined. A 30° orientation configuration of some of the InAs NWs is shown to be related to the surface corrugation of the graphene substrate. InAs NW-based devices for transport measurements were fabricated, and the conductance measurements showed a semi-ballistic behavior.

Music is an inherently social activity, and music ensembles offer a broad variety of scenarios which are particularly suitable for investigation. Small ensembles, such as string quartets, are deemed a significant example of self-managed teams, where all musicians contribute equally to a task. In bigger ensembles, such as orchestras, the relationship between a leader (the conductor) and a group of followers (the musicians) clearly emerges. This paper presents an overview of recent research on social interaction in music ensembles with a particular focus on (i) studies from cognitive neuroscience; and (ii) studies adopting a computational approach for carrying out automatic quantitative analysis of ensemble music performances.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 IEEE. Industrial wearable exoskeletons can assist the workers during manual handling of loads at manufacturing facilities. Today, one of their design challenges is to reduce weight so the worker can wear them for an extended length of time, without compromising torque and power requirements. Actuators can largely contribute to the overall weight of such devices. An elastic element in parallel can reduce the technical specifications of the actuator. However, such elastic elements are heavy with a large footprint. We present an innovative Parallel Elastic Actuator (PEA) using an elastic cord made of natural rubber elastomer, which can store energy during lowering and release it while lifting. Trunk exoskeleton requirements are analysed based on human subject data for industrial lowering and lifting scenarios. The mechanical design concept of a PEA for the hip joint of an industrial exoskeleton is discussed in detail. We formulate the mathematical model of the human-exoskeleton motion in the sagittal plane. We perform the virtual testing on industrial lowering and lifting scenarios to verify the actuator performance. The results show the improvement in weight, peak torque and peak power by 20%, 50% and 40% respectively as compared with the current prototype. The new integrated actuator consists of the direct current (DC) motor, the harmonic drive (HD) and the parallel natural rubber elements which reduce size and complexity of the trunk exoskeleton.",

When this is disturbed it changes the mechanical state of the tissue components, singularly or together, and cancer, along with other diseases, may start and progress. However, the bi-univocal mechanical interplay between cells and the ECM is still not properly understood. In this study we show how a microrheology technique gives us the opportunity to evaluate the mechanics of cells and the ECM at the same time. The mechanical phenotyping was performed on the surgically removed tissues of 10 patients affected by adenocarcinoma of the lung. A correlation between the mechanics and the grade and stage of the tumor was reported and compared to the mechanical characteristics of the healthy tissue. Our findings suggest a sort of asymmetric modification of the mechanical properties of the cells and the extra-cellular matrix in the tumor, being the more compliant cell even though it resides in a stiffer matrix. Overall, the simultaneous mechanical characterization of the tissues constituents (cells and ECM) provided new support for diagnosis and offered alternative points of analysis for cancer mechanobiology. Statement of significance: When the integrity of the mechanical cross-talk between cells and the extra-cellular matrix is disturbed cancer, along with other diseases, may initiate and progress.

The aim of this study is to explore the mechanism of drug (un)binding to the M2 channel in order to gain insight into the structural and energetic features relevant for the development of novel inhibitors. To this end, we have investigated the binding of amantadine (Amt) to the wild type (wt) M2 channel and its V27A variant using multiple independent molecular dynamics simulations, exploratory conventional metadynamics, and multiple-walkers well-tempered metadynamics calculations. The results allow us to propose a sequential mechanism for the (un)binding of Amt to the wt M2 channel, which involves the adoption of a transiently populated intermediate (up state) leading to the thermodynamically favored down binding mode in the channel pore. Furthermore, they suggest that chloride anions play a relevant role in stabilizing the down binding mode of Amt to the wt channel, giving rise to a kinetic trapping that explains the experimentally observed pseudoirreversible inhibition of the wt channel by Amt. We propose that this trapping mechanism underlies the inhibitory activity of potent M2 channel blockers, as supported by the experimental confirmation of the irreversible binding of a pyrrolidine analogue from electrophysiological current assays. Finally, the results reveal that the thermodynamics and kinetics of Amt (un)binding is very sensitive to the V27A mutation, providing a quantitative rationale to the drastic decrease in inhibitory potency against the V27A variant. Overall, these findings pave the way to explore the inhibitory activity of Amt-related analogues in mutated M2 channel variants, providing guidelines for the design of novel inhibitors against resistant virus strains.",

In particular, metal-insulator-metal structures made of vertically oriented amorphous TiO2-NTA grown on titanium foil were exploited in Ti/TiO2-NTA/Pt devices. The deposition of a polymeric thin film between NTA and top electrodes significantly improved the stability of the devices and increased by more than double the off/on resistance ratio. The resistive switching of TiO2-NTA samples crystallised by thermal annealing was also studied. Such devices displayed nonlinear I-V curves characterised by a smooth rectifying behaviour, without any evident resistive switching (RS). Also in this case, the interposition of the polymeric layer enhanced the RS behaviour of TiO2-NTA samples, remarkably increasing the devices' off/on ratio and endurance. The rise of high resistance states can be simply related to the addition of the polymer as resistance in series, while the variation of the low resistance states is here attributed to the occurrence of surface chemical reactions between polymer functional groups and the metal oxide, which increase the charge carriers available for conduction.",

Epidemiological and experimental evidence suggests a clear link between type 2 diabetes mellitus and AD. In AD animal models, tau pathology is exacerbated by metabolic comorbidities, such as insulin resistance and diabetes. Within this context, anitidiabetic drugs, including the widely-prescribed insulin-sensitizing drug metformin, are currently being investigated for AD therapy. However, their efficacy for tauopathy in vivo has not been tested. Results: Here, we report that in the P301S mutant human tau (P301S) transgenic mouse model of tauopathy, chronic administration of metformin exerts paradoxical effects on tau pathology. Despite reducing tau phosphorylation in the cortex and hippocampus via AMPK/mTOR and PP2A, metformin increases insoluble tau species (including tau oligomers) and the number of inclusions with β-sheet aggregates in the brain of P301S mice. In addition, metformin exacerbates hindlimb atrophy, increases P301S hyperactive behavior, induces tau cleavage by caspase 3 and disrupts synaptic structures. Conclusions: These findings indicate that metformin pro-aggregation effects mitigate the potential benefits arising from its dephosphorylating action, possibly leading to an overall increase of the risk of tauopathy in elderly diabetic patients.",

Its surface properties, micropatterning, degradation, and mechanical features affect not only the generation of the tissue construct in vitro, but also its in vivo functionality. The area of myocardial tissue engineering still faces significant difficulties and challenges in the design of bioactive scaffolds, which allow composition variation to accommodate divergence in the evolving myocardial structure. Here we aimed at verifying if a microstructured bioartificial scaffold alone can provoke an effect on stem cell behavior. To this purpose, we fabricated microstructured bioartificial polymeric constructs made of PLGA/gelatin mimicking anisotropic structure and mechanical properties of the myocardium. We found that PLGA/gelatin scaffolds promoted adhesion, elongation, ordered disposition, and early myocardial commitment of human mesenchymal stem cells suggesting that these constructs are able to crosstalk with stem cells in a precise and controlled manner. At the same time, the biomaterial degradation kinetics renders the PLGA/gelatin constructs very attractive for myocardial regeneration approaches.",

In this work, we synergistically combine laser-induced forward transfer (LIFT) and replica molding for the fabrication of microlenses with control of their geometry and size independent of the material or substrate used. Our approach is based on a multistep process in which liquid microdroplets of an aqueous solution are first printed on a substrate by LIFT. Following a freezing step, the microdroplets are used as a master to fabricate a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) mold. A subsequent replica molding step enables the creation of microlenses and microlens arrays on arbitrary selected substrates and by using different curable polymers. Thus, our method combines the rapid fabrication capabilities of LIFT and the perfectively smooth surface quality of the generated microdroplets, with the advantages of replica molding in terms of parallelization and materials flexibility. We demonstrate our strategy by generating microlenses of different photocurable polymers and by characterizing their optical and morphological properties.",

Unsolved issues remain the spatial integration of stem cells into damaged areas of the organ, the commitment in the required cell type and the development of improved bioengineered devices. In this respect, biomaterials and architectures have to be specialized to control stem cell differentiation. Here, we perform an extensive study on micropatterned extracellular matrix proteins, which constitute a simple and non-invasive approach to drive the differentiation of adult renal progenitor/stem cells (ARPCs) from human donors. ARPCs are interfaced with fibronectin (FN) micropatterns, in the absence of exogenous chemicals or cellular reprogramming. We obtain the differentiation towards tubular cells of ARPCs cultured in basal medium conditions, the tubular commitment thus being specifically induced by micropatterned substrates. We characterize the stability of the tubular differentiation as well as the induction of a polarized phenotype in micropatterned ARPCs. Thus, the developed cues, driving the functional commitment of ARPCs, offer a route to recreate the microenvironment of the stem cell niche in vitro, that may serve, in perspective, for the development of ARPC-based bioengineered devices.",

Medulloblastoma (MB) is the most common malignant brain tumor of pediatric age and is characterized by cells expressing stem, astroglial, and neuronal markers. Among them, stem-like cells (hMB-SLCs) represent a fraction of the tumor cell population with the potential of self-renewal and proliferation and have been associated with tumor poor prognosis. In this context, microRNAs have been described as playing a pivotal role in stem cells differentiation. In our paper, we analyze microRNAs profile and genes expression of hMB-SLCs before and after Retinoic Acid- (RA-) induced differentiation. We aimed to identify pivotal players of specific pathways sustaining stemness and/or tumor development and progression and integrate the results of our recent proteomic study. Our results uncovered 22 differentially expressed microRNAs that were used as input together with deregulated genes and proteins in the Genomatix Pathway System (GePS) analysis revealing 3 subnetworks that could be interestingly involved in the maintenance of hMB-SLCs proliferation. Taken together, our findings highlight microRNAs, genes, and proteins that are significantly modulated in hMB-SLCs with respect to their RA-differentiated counterparts and could open new perspectives for prognostic and therapeutic intervention on MB.",

In the latter type, the object is illuminated with a probe beam, and a signal detected. We can generalize the probe to a patterned illumination. Similarly we can generalize the detection to a patterned detection. Combining these we get a range of different modalities: confocal microscopy, structured illumination (with full-field imaging), spinning disk (with multiple illumination points), and so on. The combination allows the spatial frequency bandwidth of the system to be doubled. In general we can record a four dimensional (4D) image of a 2D object (or a 6D image from a 3D object, using an acoustic tuneable lens). The optimum way to directly reconstruct the resulting image is by image scanning microscopy (ISM). But the 4D image is highly redundant, so deconvolution-based approaches are also relevant. ISM can be performed in fluorescence, bright field or interference microscopy. Several different implementations have been described, with associated advantages and disadvantages. In two-photon microscopy, the illumination and detection point spread functions are very different. This is also the case when using pupil filters or when there is a large Stokes shift.",

Nowadays, it is possible to use techniques such as direct metal laser sintering (DMLS) process to overcome this problem. In the present report are summarized the activities performed at the Department of Applied Science and Technology (DISAT) of Politecnico di Torino and Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT) di Torino on the development of Ni-based superalloys produced by DMLS. More precisely, we have studied the microstructure architectures of Inconel 625 and Inconel 718 produced by M270 Dual Mode version and the impact of different heat treatments on their microstructures in order to meet the industrial requirements.",

            "abstract": "Robotics has a significant potential to enhance the overall capacity and efficiency of healthcare systems. Robots can help surgeons perform better quality operations, leading to reductions in the hospitalisation time of patients and in the impact of surgery on their postoperative quality of life. In particular, robotics can have a significant impact on microsurgery, which presents stringent requirements for superhuman precision and control of the surgical tools. Microsurgery is, in fact, expected to gain importance in a growing range of surgical specialties as novel technologies progressively enable the detection, diagnosis and treatment of diseases at earlier stages. Within such scenarios, robotic microsurgery emerges as one of the key components of future surgical interventions, and will be a vital technology for addressing major surgical challenges. Nonetheless, several issues have yet to be overcome in terms of mechatronics, perception and surgeon-robot interfaces before microsurgical robots can achieve their full potential in operating rooms. Research in this direction is progressing quickly and microsurgery robot prototypes are gradually demonstrating significant clinical benefits in challenging applications such as reconstructive plastic surgery, ophthalmology, otology and laryngology. These are reassuring results offering confidence in a brighter future for high-precision surgical interventions.",

We report on an easy, fast, eco-friendly, and reliable method for the synthesis of reduced graphene oxide/SnO2 nanocomposite as cathode material for application in microbial fuel cells (MFCs). The material was prepared starting from graphene oxide that has been reduced to graphene during the hydrothermal synthesis of the nanocomposite, carried out in a microwave system. Structural and morphological characterizations evidenced the formation of nanocomposite sheets, with SnO2 crystals of few nanometers integrated in the graphene matrix. Physico-chemical analysis revealed the formation of SnO2 nanoparticles, as well as the functionalization of the graphene by the presence of nitrogen atoms. Electrochemical characterizations put in evidence the ability of such composite to exploit a cocatalysis mechanism for the oxygen reduction reaction, provided by the presence of both SnO2 and nitrogen. In addition, the novel composite catalyst was successfully employed as cathode in seawater-based MFCs, giving electrical performances comparable to those of reference devices employing Pt as catalyst.",

Since curvature is a sufficient information in recognition and classification of shapes [11] we evaluate TAMO3 in a curvature discrimination task: curves were rendered, on one finger only, through geometrical descriptors such as elevation and inclination, in three degrees of freedom. We assessed how performance and mental workload were influenced by such descriptors. Inclination cues were confirmed to be associated with higher precision and higher mental demand, with no increase in frustration. Therefore, as delivered by our device, inclination seems to be an effective haptic cue to mentally construct curved virtual shapes. The joint analysis of aspects from psychophysics and workload confirms to be essential when designing assistive haptic devices since it provides different and complementary results.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd. The electronic band structure of an epitaxial graphene superlattice, generated by intercalating a monolayer of Cu atoms, is directly imaged by angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy. The 3.2 nm lateral period of the superlattice is induced by a varying registry between the graphene honeycomb and the Cu atoms as imposed by the heteroepitaxial interface Cu/SiC. The carbon atoms experience a lateral potential across the supercell of an estimated value of about 65 meV. The potential leads to strong energy renormalization in the band structure of the graphene layer and the emergence of mini-Dirac cones. The mini-cones' band velocity is reduced to about half of graphene's Fermi velocity. Notably, the ordering of the interfacial Cu atoms can be reversibly blocked by mild annealing. The superlattice indeed disappears at∼220 °C.",

On each trial we predict a matrix entry and then receive the true entry. We propose a Matrix Exponentiated Gradient algorithm [1] to solve this problem. We provide a mistake bound for the algorithm, which scales with the margin complexity [2, 3] of the underlying matrix. The bound suggests an interpretation where each row of the matrix is a prediction task over a finite set of objects, the columns. Using this we show that the algorithm makes a number of mistakes which is comparable up to a logarithmic factor to the number of mistakes made by the Kernel Perceptron with an optimal kernel in hindsight. We discuss applications of the algorithm to predicting as well as the best biclustering and to the problem of predicting the labeling of a graph without knowing the graph in advance.",

By electrochemical characterizations in three- and two-electrode configurations and symmetric planar devices, unique results have been obtained, with specific capacitance values up to 416 F g-1 and a highly stable capacitance behavior over 50000 charge-discharge cycles. The in-depth morphological and structural characterizations through field emission scanning electron microscopy, Raman, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller, and transmission electron microscopy analysis provides the proofs of the unique assembly of such 3D structured matrix. The unpacked MoS2 structure exhibits an excellent distribution of 1T and 2H phase sheets that are highly exposed to interaction with the electrolyte, and so available for surface/near-surface redox reactions, notwithstanding the quite low overall content of MoS2 embedded in the reduced graphene oxide (rGO) matrix. A comparison with other \"more conventional\" hybrid rGO-MoX2 electrochemically active materials, synthesized in the same conditions, is provided to support the outstanding behavior of the cosynthesized rGO-MoS2.",

Concurrent measurements of neural activity at multiple scales, sometimes performed with multimodal techniques, become increasingly important for studying brain function. However, statistical methods for their concurrent analysis are currently lacking. Here we introduce such techniques in a framework based on vine copulas with mixed margins to construct multivariate stochastic models. These models can describe detailed mixed interactions between discrete variables such as neural spike counts, and continuous variables such as local field potentials. We propose efficient methods for likelihood calculation, inference, sampling and mutual information estimation within this framework. We test our methods on simulated data and demonstrate applicability on mixed data generated by a biologically realistic neural network. Our methods hold the promise to considerably improve statistical analysis of neural data recorded simultaneously at different scales.",

On the contrary, the manipulators differ for the intermediate joint between the two members that make up each leg: a prismatic and a revolute joint. The universal joint can be actually thought of as a spherical lockable joint, featured by a serial kinematics of three revolute axes. Two of them can be locked alternately in order to provide two different universal joint configurations, which confer the two mentioned mobilities on both manipulators.

In this context, mouse/rat models with cautious and well-designed translational valence constitute an invaluable instrument in dissecting the selective nature of schizophrenia-relevant cognitive deficits, including their genetic, environmental, and neuronal/cellular mechanisms. Moreover, these models are also crucial for the implementation of more effective therapeutical strategies. Thus, based on clinical evidence in schizophrenia, here we will specifically address cognitive domains such as executive control, working memory, attention, and social cognition.

An appealing new way of doing so is through soft, wearable robots that work in parallel with the human muscles. In this paper we present the design and modelling of a tendon-driving unit that empowers a wearable, soft glove. Being portability one of our main objectives, we use only 1 motor to move 8 degrees of freedom of the hand. To achieve this we use an underactuation strategy based on the human hand's first postural synergy, which explains alone ≈60% of activities of daily living. The constrains imposed by the underactuation strategy are softened, to allow adaptability during grasping, by placing elastic elements in series with the tendons. A simulation of the dynamic behaviour of the glove on a human hand allows us to quantify the magnitude and distribution of the forces involved during usage. These results are used to guide design choices such as the power of the motor and the stiffness of the springs. The designed tendon-driving unit comprises a DC motor which drives an array of spools dimensioned according to the first postural synergy, an electromechanical clutch to hold the hand in position during static posture and a feeder mechanism to avoid slacking of the tendons around the spool. Finally, the tendon-driving unit is tested to verify that it satisfies motion and force characteristics required to assist its wearer in activities of daily living.",

Bearing this in mind, we combine the 3D nanoantennas design, developed recently by our group, with galvanic gold deposition to exploit LSPRs in the infrared spectral region. Here we report our theoretical and experimental results on this particular design. Moreover, our design comprises the use of a thin layer of Palladium, a well-known metal used for hydrogen sensing.

            "abstract": "© 2016 American Chemical Society Ultrasound-induced liquid-phase exfoliation (UILPE) is an established method to produce single- (SLG) and few-layer (FLG) graphene nanosheets starting from graphite as a precursor. In this paper we investigate the effect of the ultrasonication power in the UILPE process carried out in either N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) or ortho-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB). Our experimental results reveal that while the SLGs/FLGs concentration of the NMP dispersions is independent of the power of the ultrasonic bath during the UILPE process, in o-DCB it decreases as the ultrasonication power increases. Moreover, the ultrasonication power has a strong influence on the lateral size of the exfoliated SLGs/FLGs nanosheets in o-DCB. In particular, when UILPE is carried out at ∼600 W, we obtain dispersions composed of graphene nanosheets with a lateral size of 180 nm, whereas at higher power (∼1000 W) we produce graphene nanodots (GNDs) with an average diameter of ∼17 nm. The latter nanostructures exhibit a strong and almost excitation-independent photoluminescence emission in the UV/deep-blue region of the electromagnetic spectrum arising from the GNDs’ intrinsic states and a less intense (and strongly excitation wavelength dependent) emission in the green/red region attributed to defect states. Notably, we also observe visible emission with near-infrared excitation at 850 and 900 nm, a fingerprint of the presence of up-conversion processes. Overall, our results highlight the crucial importance of the solvent choice for the UILPE process, which under controlled experimental conditions allows the fine-tuning of the morphological properties, such as lateral size and thickness, of the graphene nanosheets toward the realization of luminescent GNDs.",

In particular, this modular relative Jacobian is designed for 3-arm parallel manipulators. It is called a relative Jacobian because it is expressed relative to the reference frames at the manipulator end-effectors. It is modular because it uses the existing information of each standalone manipulator component to arrive at the necessary expressions for the combined system. This work is part of a series of studies to express a single end-effector control of combined manipulators, in parallel as well as other types of base configurations. This holistic approach of controlling combined manipulators affords a drastic increase of the null-space dimension and the convenience to use all the principles of controlling a single manipulator for the resulting combined system. Derivation of the modular relative Jacobian for a 3-arm parallel manipulator is shown, together will simulation results.",

There is a growing experimental interest in coupling cavity photons to the cyclotron resonance excitations of electron liquids in high-mobility semiconductor quantum wells or graphene sheets. These media offer unique platforms to carry out fundamental studies of exciton-polariton condensation and cavity quantum electrodynamics in a regime, in which electron-electron interactions are expected to play a pivotal role. Here, focusing on graphene, we present a theoretical study of the impact of electron-electron interactions on a quantum Hall polariton fluid, that is a fluid of magneto-excitons resonantly coupled to cavity photons. We show that electron-electron interactions are responsible for an instability of graphene integer quantum Hall polariton fluids towards a modulated phase. We demonstrate that this phase can be detected by measuring the collective excitation spectra, which is often at a characteristic wave vector of the order of the inverse magnetic length.",

A proton caged compound, the 1-(2-nitrophenyl)- ethylhexadecyl sulfonate (HDNS), was dosed into HEK-293 at different incubation times. Samples were irradiated with filtered UV light for inducing photolysis of the HDNS and then probed by infrared spectroscopy. The intracellular acidification reaction can be followed by monitoring the consequent CO2 peak intensity variation. The total CO2 produced is similar for all the samples, hence it is only a function of the initial HDNS concentration. The way it is achieved, though, is different for the different incubation times and follows kinetics, which results in a combination of a linear CO2 increase and a steep CO2 increase followed by a decay. This is interpreted in terms of confinement of the HDNS into intracellular vesicles of variable average size and sensitive to UV light when they reach critical dimensions.",

The technological advancement of optical approaches, and the growth of their applications in neuroscience, has allowed investigations of the physio-pathology of neural networks at a single cell level. Therefore, better understanding the role of single neurons in the onset and progression of neurodegenerative conditions has resulted in a strong demand for surgical tools operating with single cell resolution. Optical systems already provide subcellular resolution to monitor and manipulate living tissues, and thus allow understanding the potentiality of surgery actuated at single cell level. In the present work, we report an in vitro experimental model of minimally invasive surgery applied on neuronal cultures expressing a genetically encoded calcium sensor. The experimental protocol entails the continuous monitoring of the network activity before and after the ablation of a single neuron, to provide a robust evaluation of the induced changes in the network activity. We report that in subpopulations of about 1000 neurons, even the ablation of a single unit produces a reduction of the overall network activity. The reported protocol represents a simple and cost effective model to study the efficacy of single-cell surgery, and it could represent a test-bed to study surgical procedures circumventing the abrupt and complete tissue removal in pathological conditions.",

Most attempts have been based on brute-force molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, which are CPU-demanding and not yet particularly accurate. We recently reported a new scaled-MD-based protocol, which showed potential for residence time prediction in drug discovery. Here, we further challenged our procedure's predictive ability by applying our methodology to a series of glucokinase activators that could be useful for treating type 2 diabetes mellitus. We combined scaled MD with experimental kinetics measurements and X-ray crystallography, promptly checking the protocol's reliability by directly comparing computational predictions and experimental measures. The good agreement highlights the potential of our scaled-MD-based approach as an innovative method for computationally estimating and predicting drug residence times.",

Enzymatic assays based on Fructosyl Amino Acid Oxidases (FAOX) represent a potential, rapid and economical strategy to measure glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), which is in turn a reliable method to monitor the insurgence and the development of diabetes mellitus. However, the engineering of naturally occurring FAOX to specifically recognize fructosyl-valine (the glycated N-terminal residue of HbA1c) has been hindered by the paucity of information on the tridimensional structures and catalytic residues of the different FAOX that exist in nature, and in general on the molecular mechanisms that regulate specificity in this class of enzymes. In this study, we use molecular dynamics simulations and advanced modeling techniques to investigate five different relevant wild-type FAOX (Amadoriase I, Amadoriase II, PnFPOX, FPOX-E and N1-1-FAOD) in order to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that drive their specificity towards polar and nonpolar substrates. Specifically, we compare these five different FAOX in terms of overall folding, ligand entry tunnels, ligand binding residues and ligand binding energies. Our work will contribute to future enzyme structure modifications aimed at the rational design of novel biosensors for the monitoring of blood glucose levels.",

Based on the structural motif of a robust organic dye, new largely π-extended organic sensitizers for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been designed to optimize the interactions between the dye/TiO2 layer and the redox electrolyte. The molecular tailoring was performed by i) positioning an alkyl chain onto the π-spacer and ii) increasing the bulkiness of the electron-donor. A deep theoretical investigation reveals that the main electronic transitions of the three dyes own only a weak charge-transfer character. Notwithstanding these unusual photo-excitation dynamics experimentally supported by solvatochromism, impressive photovoltaic performances are obtained for the three sensitizers, reaching power conversion efficiencies up to 9.8% under 1.0 sun illumination, that were remarkably higher than those shown by N719 standard. This result represents one of the highest performances exhibited by fully organic sensitizers employing the I-/I3 - redox shuttle.",

The first genetic variant of β2-microglobulin (b2M) associated with a familial form of systemic amyloidosis has been recently described. The mutated protein, carrying a substitution of Asp at position 76 with an Asn (D76N b2M), exhibits a strongly enhanced amyloidogenic tendency to aggregate with respect to the wild-type protein. In this study, we characterized the D76N b2M aggregation path and performed an unprecedented analysis of the biochemical mechanisms underlying aggregate cytotoxicity. We showed that, contrarily to what expected from other amyloid studies, early aggregates of the mutant are not the most toxic species, despite their higher surface hydrophobicity. By modulating ganglioside GM1 content in cell membrane or synthetic lipid bilayers, we confirmed the pivotal role of this lipid as aggregate recruiter favouring their cytotoxicity. We finally observed that the aggregates bind to the cell membrane inducing an alteration of its elasticity (with possible functional unbalance and cytotoxicity) in GM1-enriched domains only, thus establishing a link between aggregate-membrane contact and cell damage.",

The cycle of a synaptic vesicle (SV) within the nerve terminal is a step-by-step journey with the final goal of ensuring the proper synaptic strength under changing environmental conditions. The SV cycle is a precisely regulated membrane traffic event in cells and, because of this, a plethora of membrane-bound and cytosolic proteins are devoted to assist SVs in each step of the journey. The cycling fate of endocytosed SVs determines both the availability for subsequent rounds of release and the lifetime of SVs in the terminal and is therefore crucial for synaptic function and plasticity. Molecular players that determine the destiny of SVs in nerve terminals after a round of exo-endocytosis are largely unknown. Here we review the functional role in SV fate of phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of SV proteins and of small GTPases acting on membrane trafficking at the synapse, as they are emerging as key molecules in determining the recycling route of SVs within the nerve terminal. In particular, we focus on: (i) the cyclin-dependent kinase-5 (cdk5) and calcineurin (CN) control of the recycling pool of SVs; (ii) the role of small GTPases of the Rab and ADP-ribosylation factor (Arf) families in defining the route followed by SV in their nerve terminal cycle. These regulatory proteins together with their synaptic regulators and effectors, are molecular nanomachines mediating homeostatic responses in synaptic plasticity and potential targets of drugs modulating the efficiency of synaptic transmission.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 Author(s).Molecular orientation within azopolymer thin films is important for their nonlinear optical properties and photonic applications. We have used optical second-harmonic generation (SHG) to study the molecular orientation of Layer-by-Layer (LbL) films of a cationic polyelectrolyte (poly(allylamine hydrochloride)) and an anionic polyelectrolyte containing azochromophore side groups (MA-co-DR13) on a glass substrate. The SHG measurements indicate that there is a preferential orientation of the azochromophores in the film, leading to a significant optical nonlinearity. However, both the signal strength and its anisotropy are not homogeneous throughout the sample, indicating the presence of large orientational domains. This is corroborated with Brewster angle microscopy. The average SHG signal does not increase with film thickness, in contrast to some reports in the literature, indicating an independent orientational order for successive bilayers. Analyzing the SHG signal as a function of the input and output polarizations, a few parameters of the azochromophore orientational distribution can be deduced. Fitting the SHG signal to a simple model distribution, we have concluded that the chromophores have an angular distribution with a slight in-plane anisotropy and a mean polar angle ranging from 45° to 80° with respect to substrate normal direction, with a relatively large width of about 25°. These results show that SHG is a powerful technique for a detailed investigation of the molecular orientation in azopolymer LbL films, allowing a deeper understanding of their self-assembling mechanism and nonlinear optical properties. The inhomogeneity and anisotropy of these films may have important consequences for their applications in nonlinear optical devices.",

The crystal structures of MGL that are currently available provide valuable information about how this enzyme might function and interact with site-directed small-molecule inhibitors. On the other hand, its conformational equilibria and the contribution of regulatory cysteine residues present within the substrate-binding pocket or on protein surface remain open issues. Several classes of MGL inhibitors have been developed, from early reversible ones, such as URB602 and pristimerin, to carbamoylating agents that react with the catalytic serine, such as JZL184 and more recent O-hexafluoroisopropyl carbamates. Other inhibitors that modulate MGL activity by interacting with conserved regulatory cysteines act through mechanisms that deserve to be more thoroughly investigated.",

The joint effect of such a morphology and of the very small particle size and spacing led to a corresponding uniaxial wrinkling of graphene in the absence of detectable strain. The deposition of graphene redshifted the Au plasmon-resonance, strongly increased the optical absorption of the array and, most importantly, induced a marked optical anisotropy in the plasmonic response, absent in the pristine nanoparticle array. The experimental observations are accounted for by invoking a graphene-mediated resistive coupling between the Au nanoparticles, where the optical anisotropy arises from the wrinkling-induced anisotropic electron mobility in graphene at optical frequencies.",

Controls are usually developed for locomotion or for manipulation purposes. Resulting motions are usually executed sequentially and the potentiality of the robotic platform is not fully exploited. In this work we consider the problem of loco-manipulation planning for a robot with given parametrized control laws known as primitives. Such primitives, may have not been designed to be executed simultaneously and by composing them instability may easily arise. With the proposed approach, primitives combination that guarantee stability of the system are obtained resulting in complex whole-body behavior. A formal definition of motion primitives is provided and a random sampling approach on a manifold with limited dimension is investigated. Probabilistic completeness and asymptotic optimality are also proved. The proposed approach is tested both on a mobile manipulator and on the humanoid robot Walk-Man, performing loco-manipulation tasks.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 Key et al.While current imaging modalities, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography, and positron emission tomography, play an important role in detecting tumors in the body, no single-modality imaging possesses all the functions needed for a complete diagnostic imaging, such as spatial resolution, signal sensitivity, and tissue penetration depth. For this reason, multimodal imaging strategies have become promising tools for advanced biomedical research and cancer diagnostics and therapeutics. In designing multimodal nanoparticles, the physicochemical properties of the nanoparticles should be engineered so that they successfully accumulate at the tumor site and minimize nonspecific uptake by other organs. Finely altering the nano-scale properties can dramatically change the biodistribution and tumor accumulation of nanoparticles in the body. In this study, we engineered multimodal nanoparticles for both MRI, by using ferrimagnetic nanocubes (NCs), and near infrared fluorescence imaging, by using cyanine 5.5 fluorescence molecules. We changed the physicochemical properties of glycol chitosan nanoparticles by conjugating bladder cancer-targeting peptides and loading many ferrimagnetic iron oxide NCs per glycol chitosan nanoparticle to improve MRI contrast. The 22 nm ferrimagnetic NCs were stabilized in physiological conditions by encapsulating them within modified chitosan nanoparticles. The multimodal nanoparticles were compared with in vivo MRI and near infrared fluorescent systems. We demonstrated significant and important changes in the biodistribution and tumor accumulation of nanoparticles with different physicochemical properties. Finally, we demonstrated that multimodal nanoparticles specifically visualize small tumors and show minimal accumulation in other organs. This work reveals the importance of finely modulating physicochemical properties in designing multimodal nanoparticles for bladder cancer imaging.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 IEEE. Bilateral telemanipulation refers to frameworks in which a human operator manipulates a master robotic interface and a slave robotic device emulates the behavior of the master, while haptic feedback is provided to the operator. For multi-contact bilateral teleoperation we intend master and slave systems that can establish multiple contact points with the user and with the environment. A paradigmatic example can be a multi-fingered robotic hand teleoperated by the human hand. Two of the most critical issues in this context are: (i) how to provide haptic feedback on multiple points of the human hand; (ii) how to solve the correspondence problem between the human hand and the robotic slave device. In this work, we propose finger-worn devices able to apply a three dimensional vector of force at a specific contact point to solve the multicontact feedback problem. For the correspondence problem, we propose an object-based mapping procedure. The approach is based on two virtual objects, defined both at the master and slave sides, to capture the human hand motion and to compute the related force feedback. The proposed approach has been tested in a telemanipulation framework where the master side was composed of a Leap Motion sensor used to track the hand plus three wearable haptic devices, while a robotic hand/arm system performed a manipulation task as slave.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 IEEE.We propose a novel bilateral telemanipulation framework to tame master and slave devices having different structures. This condition applies to multi-contact teleoperation scenarios where the number of contact points on the slave side and the number of interaction points on the master side are different. An example is a master device interacting with the thumb and the index fingertips of the human operator and, as slave device, a robotic arm with a multi-fingered robotic hand. In case of a manipulation task, it is not straightforward to transmit motion commands and reflect forces from the interaction with the environment. A general telemanipulation framework, that does not consider the specific kinematics of the devices involved, is needed. The main idea of this work is to take advantage of a virtual object as a mediator between the master and slave side. The arising forward and backward mapping algorithms are able to relate the motions and the exerted forces of very dissimilar systems. The approach has been evaluated in a case study consisting of two haptic interfaces used both to track the index and thumb motions and to render forces on the master side and a robotic arm with a multi-fingered hand as end-effector on the slave side. The results presented in this paper can be extended to cooperative grasping scenarios where multiple robots tele-manipulate the same object.",

Here, we report a newly designed class of solution-processed highly sensitive MEG-assisted photosensors of CdHgTe NCs, in which the charge accumulation is dramatically enhanced for photon energies greater than two times the bandgap of the employed NCs. We fabricated and comparatively studied five types of devices based on different NC monolayers of selected quantum-confined bandgaps resulting in different levels of photovoltage buildup readouts. Among these photosensitive platforms, MEG is distinctly observed for CdHgTe NCs, as the number of electrons trapped inside these NCs and the number of holes accumulating into the interfacing metal electrode were increased beyond a single exciton per absorbed photon. Furthermore, we conducted time-resolved fluorescence measurements and confirmed the occurrence of MEG in the CdHgTe NC monolayer of the photosensor. These findings pave the way for engineering of multiexciton kinetics in high-efficiency NC-based photosensors and photovoltaics.",

Here, we report a simple, novel strategy to design an engineered nanocarrier system featuring an oil-core/hybrid polymer/silica-shell. Silica shells with a tunable thickness were grown in situ, directly around a highly mono-disperse and stable oil-in-water emulsion system, stabilized by a double bio-functional polyelectrolyte heparin/chitosan layer. Such silica showed a complete degradation in a physiological medium (SBF) in a time frame of three days. Moreover, the outer silica shell was coated with polyethyleneglycol (PEG) in order to confer antifouling properties to the final nanocapsule. The outer silica layer combined its properties (it is an optimal bio-interface for bio-conjugations and for the embedding of hydrophilic drugs in the porous structure) with the capability to stabilize the oil core for the confinement of high payloads of lipophilic tracers (e.g. CdSe quantum dots, Nile Red) and drugs. In addition, polymer layers - besides conferring stability to the emulsion while building the silica shell - can be independently exploited if suitably functionalized, as demonstrated by conjugating chitosan with fluorescein isothiocyanate. Such numerous features in a single nanocarrier system make it very intriguing as a multifunctional platform for smart diagnosis and therapy.",

A planning algorithm is proposed to move different objects in desired configurations with heterogeneous robots such as manipulators, mobile robots and conveyor belts. The proposed approach allows different objects to be handled by different robots simultaneously in an efficient way and avoiding collisions with the environment and self-collisions between robots. In particular, the integrated system will be capable of planning paths for a set of objects from various starting points in the environment (e.g. shelves) to their respective final destinations. The proposed approach unifies the active (e.g., grasping by a hand) and passive (e.g., holding by a table) steps involved in moving the objects in the environment by treating them as end-effectors with constraints and capabilities. Time varying graphs will be introduced to model the problem for simultaneous handling of objects by different end-effectors. Optimal exploration of such graphs will be used to determine paths for each object with time constraints. Results will be validated through simulations.",

            "abstract": "© 2015 Elsevier B.V. Cell-based assays of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) using split reporter proteins can be used to identify PPI agonists and antagonists. Generally, such assays measure one PPI at a time, and thus counterscreens for on-target activity must be run in parallel or at a subsequent stage; this increases both the cost and time during screening. Split luciferase systems offer advantages over those that use split fluorescent proteins (FPs). This is since split luciferase offers a greater signal:noise ratio and, unlike split FPs, the PPI can be reversed upon small molecule treatment. While multiplexed PPI assays using luciferase have been reported, they suffer from low signal:noise and require fairly complex spectral deconvolution during analysis. Furthermore, the luciferase enzymes used are large, which limits the range of PPIs that can be interrogated due to steric hindrance from the split luciferase fragments. Here, we report a multiplexed PPI assay based on split luciferases from Photinus pyralis (firefly luciferase, FLUC) and the deep-sea shrimp, Oplophorus gracilirostris (NanoLuc, NLUC). Specifically, we show that the binding of the p53 tumor suppressor to its two major negative regulators, MDM2 and MDM4, can be simultaneously measured within the same sample, without the requirement for complex filters or deconvolution. We provide chemical and genetic validation of this system using MDM2-targeted small molecules and mutagenesis, respectively. Combined with the superior signal:noise and smaller size of split NanoLuc, this multiplexed PPI assay format can be exploited to study the induction or disruption of pairwise interactions that are prominent in many cell signaling pathways.",

All rights reserved.Conducting polymers are materials displaying high electrical conductivity, easy of fabrication, flexibility and biocompatibility, for this, they are routinely employed in organic electronics, printed electronics, and bioelectronics. Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) are a second generation of organic thin transistors, in which the insulator layer is an electrolyte medium and the conductive polymer is electrochemically active. OECT devices have been demonstrated in chemical and biological sensing: While accurate in determining the size of individual ions in solution, similar devices break down if challenged with complex mixtures. Here, we combine a conductive PEODOT:PSS polymer with a super-hydrophobic scheme to obtain a family of advanced devices, in which the ability to manipulate a biological solution couples to a precise texture of the substrate (which incorporates five micro-electrodes in a line, and each is a site specific measurement point), and this permits to realize time and space resolved analysis of a solution. While the competition between convection and diffusion in a super-hydrophobic drop operates the separation of different species based on their size and charge, the described device delivers the ability to register a similar difference. In the following, we demonstrate the device in the sensing of a solution in which CTAB and adrenaline are separated with good sensitivity, selectivity and reliability.",

We propose an up-scalable, reliable, contamination-free, rod-like TiO2 material grown by a new method based on sputtering deposition concepts which offers a multi-scale porosity, namely: an intra-rods nano-porosity (1-5 nm) arising from the Thornton's conditions and an extra-rods meso-porosity (10-50 nm) originating from the spatial separation of the Titanium and Oxygen sources combined with a grazing Ti flux. The procedure is simple, since it does not require any template layer to trigger the nano-structuring, and versatile, since porosity and layer thickness can be easily tuned; it is empowered by the lack of contaminations/solvents and by the structural stability of the material (at least) up to 500 °C. Our material gains porosity, stability and infiltration capability superior if compared to conventionally sputtered TiO2 layers. Its competition level with chemically synthesized reference counterparts is doubly demonstrated: in Dye Sensitized Solar Cells, by the infiltration and chemisorption of N-719 dye (∼1 × 1020 molecules/cm3); and in Perovskite Solar Cells, by the capillary infiltration of solution processed CH3NH3PbI3 which allowed reaching efficiency of 11.7%. Based on the demonstrated attitude of the material to be functionalized, its surface activity could be differently tailored on other molecules or gas species or liquids to enlarge the range of application in different fields.",

Current drug treatment has demonstrated only symptomatic efficacy, leaving an unmet medical need for a new generation of disease-modifying therapies. Following the multitarget-directed ligand approach, a small library of coumarin-based derivatives was designed and synthesized as a follow-up to our studies on AP2238, aimed at expanding its biological profile. The coumarin substitution pattern at the 6- or 7-position was modified by introducing alkyl chains of variable lengths and with different terminal amino functional groups. 3-(4-{[Benzyl(ethyl)amino]methyl}phenyl)-6-({5-[(7-methoxy-6H-indeno[2,1-b]quinolin-11-yl)amino]pentyl}oxy)-2H-chromen-2-one, bearing the bulkiest amine, emerged as a non-neurotoxic dual acetylcholinesterase (AChE)/butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) inhibitor, potentially suitable for the treatment of the middle stage of AD. Furthermore, the introduction of a diethylamino spacer, as in 3-(4-{[benzyl(ethyl)amino]methyl}phenyl)-6-{[5-(diethylamino)pentyl]oxy}-2H-chromen-2-one and 3-(4-{[benzyl(ethyl)amino]methyl}phenyl)-7-[4-(diethylamino)butoxy]-2H-chromen-2-one, led to nanomolar human AChE inhibitors endowed with significant inhibitory activity toward Aβ42 self-aggregation, whereas the reference compound was completely ineffective. Furthermore, 3-(4-{[benzyl(ethyl)amino]methyl}phenyl)-7-[4-(diethylamino)butoxy]-2H-chromen-2-one also showed promising neuroprotective behavior, which makes it a potential candidate for development into a disease-modifying agent.",

The aim was to evaluate optimal channels and band-power (BP) features for motor imagery tasks discrimination, in order to assess the feasibility of a portable low-cost motor imagery based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) system. The minimal sub set of features most relevant to task description and less redundant to each other was determined, and the corresponding classification accuracy was assessed offline employing linear support vector machine (SVM) in a 10-fold cross validation scheme. The analysis was performed: (a) on the original full Dataset I from BCI competition IV, (b) on a restricted channels set from Dataset I corresponding to available Emotiv EPOC electrodes locations, and (c) on data recorded with the EPOC system. Results from (a) showed that an offline classification accuracy above 80% can be reached using only 5 features. Limiting the analysis to EPOC channels caused a decrease of classification accuracy, although it still remained above chance level, both for data from (b) and (c). A top accuracy of 70% was achieved using 2 optimal features. These results encourage further research towards the development of portable low cost motor imagery-based BCI systems.",

Thus, new strategies for TB control and treatment are highly demanded.

            "abstract": "© Enrico Mugnaioli et al. 2016.(Nax□1 - x)5[MnO2]13 has been synthesized with x = 0.80 (4), corresponding to Na0.31[MnO2]. This well known material is usually cited as Na0.4[MnO2] and is believed to have a romanèchite-like framework. Here, its true structure is determined, ab initio, by single-crystal electron diffraction tomography (EDT) and refined both by EDT data applying dynamical scattering theory and by the Rietveld method based on synchrotron powder diffraction data (X2 = 0.690, Rwp = 0.051, Rp = 0.037, RF2 = 0.035). The unit cell is monoclinic C2/m, a = 22.5199 (6), b = 2.83987 (6), c = 14.8815 (4) Å , β = 105.0925 (16)°, V = 918.90 (4) Å3, Z = 2. A hitherto unknown [MnO2] framework is found, which is mainly based on edge- and corner-sharing octahedra and comprises three types of tunnels: per unit cell, two are defined by S-shaped 10-rings, four by eggshaped 8-rings, and two by slightly oval 6-rings of Mn polyhedra. Na occupies all tunnels. The so-determined structure excellently explains previous reports on the electrochemistry of (Na,□)5[MnO2]13. The trivalent Mn3+ ions concentrate at two of the seven Mn sites where larger Mn-O distances and Jahn-Teller distortion are observed. One of the Mn3+ sites is five-coordinated in a square pyramid which, on oxidation to Mn4+, may easily undergo topotactic transformation to an octahedron suggesting a possible pathway for the transition among different tunnel structures.",

Such pharmacogenomic tests are not routinely performed on psoriasis patients, due to the high cost of standard technologies. We demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity of our colorimetric test by validating it on a cohort of 30 patients, through a double-blind comparison with two state-of-the-art instrumental techniques, namely reverse dot blotting and sequencing, finding 100% agreement. This test offers high parallelization capabilities and can be easily generalized to other SNPs of clinical relevance, finding broad utility in diagnostics and pharmacogenomics.",

The performance of ionic liquid (IL) electrolytes based on N-alkyl-N-ethylpyrrolidinium cations combined with different lithium salts has been used for the design of safer lithium battery systems. These mixtures of ILs, synthesized through an eco-friendly procedure route, and salts were studied and their performance was compared on the basis of anion species. The N-butyl-N-ethylpyrrolidinium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide/lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (PYR24FSI-LiFSI) mixture was found to exhibit superior characteristics in terms of ion transport properties even at low temperatures in combination with wide electrochemical stability, feasibility of reversibly plating lithium metal without any reduction of electrolyte and good compatibility with Li anode. These are considered to be due to good film-forming ability of the FSI anion. Conversely, lower thermal stability was also observed. Preliminary tests in lithium/lithium iron phosphate, Li/LiFePO4, half-cells using PYR24FSI-LiFSI as the electrolyte evidenced cycling performance approaching that in organic electrolytes with high capacity retention and efficiency values.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd. We present a nanoembossed nanoshell with a new internal location for the formation of strong electromagnetic fields. The internally nanoembossed gold nanoshell (AuNS) is fabricated by electrostatically assembling smaller silica nanoparticles (∼15.7 nm) around the silica core (∼123.6 nm) followed by growing gold nanoseeds on the core in a wet process. FDTD calculations reveal the creation of a strong electromagnetic field (|E/Ein|max = 55 at 633 nm) at sharp edges formed by the contact between the nanoembosses and the silica core. The field formation is supported by measuring the SERS signal of Ru(bpy) encapsulated in the nanoembossing silica nanoparticles. SERS signals as strong as the corresponding fluorescence are obtained. The Raman enhancement factor (EF) is estimated to be up to 1010 at 633 nm excitation, in addition to a comparable EF at 785 nm laser excitation. The SERS intensity of the nanoembossed nanoshell layer is sufficiently high compared to the outer or the core of the nanoshell. Finally, we fabricate all-in-one nanoparticles with all the three places where the reporter dyes are loaded and acquire the highest SERS intensity to potentially enable bio-medical applications of the nanoembossed AuNS as a sensitive and reliable labeling particle.",

Some cellular mechanisms such as migration and invasion, are determined and regulated by cell mechanical properties, especially during embryonic development or tumorigenesis. In these cases, cells attitude to undergo deformation and to displace their whole body is a crucial point for survival and metastasis formation. Extracellular environment three-dimensionality is a key feature influencing cell mechanics, and micro- and nano-fabricated structures represent a promising tool to study cell behavior. Here we engineer 3D- cage-like microstructures realized by two-photon polymerization to analyze cell migration through pores significantly smaller than the cell nucleus. We found that cells spontaneously interact with the cages by applying force at the cell-cage contact points while rearranging their cytoskeleton. The ability to traverse pores of different area depends on the invasiveness of the cell lines, allowing to discriminate between cells with different invasive potential.",

The combination of holographic optical tweezers and digital holography gives the cell footholds for adhesion and mechanical stimulation, and at the same time, acts as a label-free, force-revealing system over time, detecting the cell nanomechanical response in the pN range. To confirm the formation of the cytoskeleton structures after the stimulation, a fluorescence imaging system was added as a control. The strategy here proposed portends broad applicability to investigate the correlation between the forces applied to cells and their cytoskeleton assembly process in this or other complex configurations with multiple anchor points.",

Neurostimulation represents a powerful and well-established tool for the treatment of several diseases affecting the central nervous system. Although, effective in reducing the symptoms or the progression of brain disorders, the poor accessibility of the deepest areas of the brain currently hampers the possibility of a more specific and controlled therapeutic stimulation, depending on invasive surgical approaches and long-term stability, and biocompatibility issues. The massive research of the last decades on nanomaterials and nanoscale devices favored the development of new tools to address the limitations of the available neurostimulation approaches. This mini-review focuses on the employment of nanoparticles for the modulation of the electrophysiological activity of neuronal networks and the related transduction mechanisms underlying the nanostructure-neuron interfaces.",

The long-lived protein layer tightly bound to the NP surface is referred to as the hard corona (HC) and encodes information that controls NP bioactivity (e.g. cellular association, cellular signaling pathways, biodistribution, and toxicity). Decrypting this complex code has become a priority to predict the NP biological outcomes. Here, we use a library of 16 lipid NPs of varying size (Ø ≈ 100-250 nm) and surface chemistry (unmodified and PEGylated) to investigate the relationships between NP physicochemical properties (nanoparticle size, aggregation state and surface charge), protein corona fingerprints (PCFs), and NP-cell association. We found out that none of the NPs' physicochemical properties alone was exclusively able to account for association with human cervical cancer cell line (HeLa). For the entire library of NPs, a total of 436 distinct serum proteins were detected. We developed a predictive-validation modeling that provides a means of assessing the relative significance of the identified corona proteins. Interestingly, a minor fraction of the HC, which consists of only 8 PCFs were identified as main promoters of NP association with HeLa cells. Remarkably, identified PCFs have several receptors with high level of expression on the plasma membrane of HeLa cells.",

This is a novel research field of particular interest, thought to extend the application fields or enhance the performance of porous polymers because of the improved properties of nanoporous structures obtained from nanostructure polymer blends. A brief introduction about the advantages, properties, and characteristics of porous polymer foams is first provided. The use of nanostructured polymers, blends, and polyphasic polymers as precursors of porous polymers is then described, as well as the main production routes leading to porous polymers. Key features of the nanostructured polymer blends for the potential production of polymer foams are exposed based on theoretical and experimental evidence, providing a thorough review of the nanostructured polymer blends successfully used with this aim, as well as of the obtained porous structures from these solid nanostructured precursors. Characterization of the initial nanostructuration and the resulting porous structures leads to the first evidence about the underlying mechanism controlling the nucleation and growing of the porous structure. The complete understanding and control of these mechanisms will allow tailoring the porous structures and properties of these materials. Finally, the enhanced physical properties that these nanoporous materials present, as well as their potential applications and future perspectives, are described based on the significant results on this subject recently published.",

Nanoporous polymeric materials are porous materials with pore sizes in the nanometer range (i.e., below 200 nm), processed as bulk or film materials, and from a wide set of polymers. Over the last several years, research and development on these novel materials have progressed significantly, because it is believed that the reduction of the pore size to the nanometer range could strongly influence some of the properties of porous polymers, providing unexpected and improved properties compared to conventional porous and microporous polymers and non-porous solids. In this review, the key properties of these nanoporous polymeric materials (mechanical, thermal, dielectric, optical, filtration, sensing, etc.) are analyzed. The experimental and theoretical results obtained up to date related to the structure-property relations are presented. In several sections, in order to present a more compressive approach, the trends obtained for nanoporous polymers are compared to those for metallic and ceramic nanoporous systems. Moreover, some specific characteristics of these materials, such as the consequences of the confinement of both gas and solid phases, are described. Likewise, the main production methods are briefly described. Finally, some of the potential applications of these materials are also discussed in this paper.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 American Chemical Society. Silver is the ideal material for plasmonics because of its low loss at optical frequencies, though it is often replaced by a lossier metal, gold. This is because of silver's tendency to tarnish, an effect which is enhanced at the nanoscale due to the large surface-to-volume ratio. Despite chemical tarnishing of Ag nanoparticles (NPs) has been extensively studied for decades, it has not been well understood whether resulted by sulfidation or oxidation processes. This intriguing quest is herein rationalized by studying the atmospheric corrosion of electron beam lithography-fabricated Ag NPs, through nanoscale investigation performed by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) combined with electron energy loss (EEL) and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopies. We demonstrate that tarnishing of Ag NPs upon exposure to indoor air of an environment located inside a rural site, not particularly influenced by naturally and human-made sulfur sources, is caused by chemisorbed sulfur-based contaminants rather than via an oxidation process. Furthermore, we show that the sulfidation occurs through the formation of crystalline Ag2S bumps onto Ag surface in place of a homogeneous growth of a silver sulfide film. From a single 2D Z-contrast scanning transmission electron microscopy image, a method for 3D reconstruction of silver nanoparticles with extremely high spatial resolution has been derived thus establishing the preferential nucleation of Ag2S bumps in proximity of lattice defects located on the NP surface. Finally, we also provide a straightforward and low-cost solution to achieve stable Ag NPs by passivating them with a self-assembled monolayer of hexanethiols. The sulfidation mechanism inhibition allows to prevent the increased material damping and scattering losses.",

Herein we report a nanostructural study by means of XRD and (HR)TEM of high aspect ratio TiO2-NTs hydrothermally converted into BaTiO3. The nanostructure shows two different and well-defined regions: at the top the conversion involves complete dissolution of NTs and subsequent precipitation of BaTiO3 crystals by homogeneous nucleation, followed by the growth of dendritic structures by aggregation and oriented attachment mechanisms. Instead, at the bottom, the low liquid/solid ratio, due to the limited amount of Ba solution that infiltrates the NTs, leads to the rapid crystallization of such a solution into BaTiO3, thus allowing the NTs to act as a template for the formation of highly oriented one-dimensional nanostructures. The in-depth analysis of the structural transformations that take place during the formation of the rod-like arrays of BaTiO3 could help elucidate the conversion mechanism, thus paving the way for the optimization of the synthesis process in view of new applications in energy harvesting devices, where easy and low temperature processing, controlled composition, morphology and functional properties are required.",

To facilitate its reduction (Oxygen Reduction Reaction—ORR), a proper catalyst is needed and platinum is considered the best one due to its low overpotential for this reaction. By considering the high price of platinum, alternative catalysts are needed and manganese oxides (MnxOy) can be considered promising substitutes. They are inexpensive, environmental friendly and can be obtained into several forms; most of them show significant electro-catalytic performance, even if strategies are needed to increase their efficiency. In particular, by developing light and high-surface area materials and by optimizing the presence of catalytic sites, we can obtain a cathode with improved electro-catalytic performance. In this case, nanofibers and xerogels are two of the most promising nanostructures that can be used in the field of catalysis. In this work, a study of the morphological and catalytic behavior of MnxOy nanofibers and xerogels is proposed. Nanofibers were obtained by electrospinning, while xerogels were prepared by sol-gel and freeze drying techniques. Despite of the different preparation approaches, the obtained nanostructured manganese oxides exhibited similar catalytic performance for the ORR, comparable to those obtained from Pt catalysts.",

In order for humanoids to be compatible with our everyday tools and our lifestyle it is however mandatory to reproduce (at least partially) the body-mind nexus that makes humans so superior to machines. This requires a totally new approach to humanoid technologies, combining new responsive and soft materials, bioinspired sensors, high efficiency power sources and cognition/intelligence of low computational cost: in other words, an unprecedented merge of nanotechnology, cognition and mechatronics.",

            "abstract": "Phospholipids in the brain cell membranes contain different polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), which are critical to nervous system function and structure. In particular, brain function critically depends on the uptake of the so-called â € essentialâ € fatty acids such as omega-3 (n-3) and omega-6 (n-6) PUFAs that cannot be readily synthesized by the human body. We extracted natural lecithin rich in various PUFAs from a marine source and transformed it into nanoliposomes. These nanoliposomes increased neurite outgrowth, network complexity and neural activity of cortical rat neurons in vitro. We also observed an upregulation of synapsin I (SYN1), which supports the positive role of lecithin in synaptogenesis, synaptic development and maturation. These findings suggest that lecithin nanoliposomes enhance neuronal development, which may have an impact on devising new lecithin delivery strategies for therapeutic applications.",

Over the last 20 years, many promising multitarget-directed ligands (MTDLs) have been identified and developed at a pre-clinical level. However, how to design them in a rational way remains the most fundamental challenge of medicinal chemists. This is related to the foundational question of achieving an optimized activity towards multiple targets of interest, while preserving drug-like properties. In this respect, large hybrid molecules and small fragments are poles apart. In this review article, our aim is to appraise what we have accomplished in the development of both hybrid- and fragment-like molecules directed to diverse AD targets (i.e., acetylcholinesterase, NMDA receptors, metal chelation, BACE-1 and GSK-3β). In addition, we attempt to highlight what are the persistent needs that deserve to be improved and cared for, with the ultimate goal of moving an MTDL to AD clinical studies.",

Recent developments in the exploitation of transparent conductive oxide nanocrystals paved the way to the realization of a new class of electrochemical systems capable of selectively shielding the infrared heat loads carried by sunlight and prospected the blooming of a key enabling technology to be implemented in the next generation of “zero-energy” building envelopes. Here we report the fabrication of a set of electrochromic devices embodying an engineered nanostructured electrode made by high aspect-ratio tungsten oxide nanorods, which allow for selectively and dynamically controlling sunlight transmission over the near-infrared to visible range. Varying the intensity of applied voltage makes the spectral response of the device change across three different optical regimes, namely fully transparent, near-infrared only blocking and both visible and near-infrared blocking. It is demonstrated that the degree of reversible modulation of the thermal radiation entering the glazing element can approach a remarkable 85%, accompanied by only a modest reduction in the luminous transmittance.",

Graphene hosts a unique electron system in which electron-phonon scattering is extremely weak but electron-electron collisions are sufficiently frequent to provide local equilibrium above the temperature of liquid nitrogen. Under these conditions, electrons can behave as a viscous liquid and exhibit hydrodynamic phenomena similar to classical liquids. Here we report strong evidence for this transport regime.We found that doped graphene exhibits an anomalous (negative) voltage drop near current-injection contacts, which is attributed to the formation of submicrometer-sizewhirlpools in the electron flow.The viscosity of graphene's electron liquid is found to be ~0.1 squaremeters per second, an order of magnitude higher than that of honey, in agreement with many-body theory. Our work demonstrates the possibility of studying electron hydrodynamics using high-quality graphene.",

They are used to detect and to reconstruct the physical motion of shoulder and elbow joints of the operator. Given human operator's motion as reference trajectories, the robot is controlled using NN technique to compensate for its unknown dynamics. Adaptive law has been synthesized based on Lyapunov theory to enable effective NN learning.

Categorical decisions can be used to study decision making more generally by dissociating category identity of stimuli from the actions subjects use to signal their decisions. Here we discuss the evidence for such abstract categorical encoding in the primate brain and consider the relationship with other perceptual decision paradigms. Recent work on visual categorization has examined neuronal activity across a hierarchically organized network of cortical areas in monkeys trained to group visual stimuli into arbitrary categories. This has revealed a transformation of visual-feature encoding in early visual cortical areas into more flexible categorical representations in downstream parietal and prefrontal areas. These neuronal category representations are encoded as abstract internal cognitive states because they are not rigidly linked with either specific sensory stimuli or the actions that the monkeys use to signal their categorical choices.",

We study a regularizer which is defined as a parameterized infimum of quadratics, and which we call the box-norm. We show that the k-support norm, a regularizer proposed by Argyriou et al. (2012) for sparse vector prediction problems, belongs to this family, and the box-norm can be generated as a perturbation of the former. We derive an improved algorithm to compute the proximity operator of the squared box-norm, and we provide a method to compute the norm. We extend the norms to matrices, introducing the spectral k-support norm and spectral box-norm. We note that the spectral box-norm is essentially equivalent to the cluster norm, a multitask learning regularizer introduced by Jacob et al. (2009a), and which in turn can be interpreted as a perturbation of the spectral k-support norm. Centering the norm is important for multitask learning and we also provide a method to use centered versions of the norms as regularizers. Numerical experiments indicate that the spectral k-support and box-norms and their centered variants provide state of the art performance in matrix completion and multitask learning problems respectively.",

Indeed, due to the overwhelming increase of the worldwide demand for high-tech products, energy storage has become one of the most up-to-date debating topics. In this regard, and considering also the well-known environmental issues often related to the fabrication of new energy products, it is important for the scientific community to develop new electrochemical energy storage systems based on eco-efficient synthetic processes and capable of serving the needs of the next generation of electronics. To this end, textile-based energy storage devices are emerging as a viable alternative to their conventional rigid counterparts. These devices have to be flexible, lightweight and should be compatible with futuristic miniaturized electronic gadgets. We have discussed how supercapacitors and Li-ion batteries are combined with textiles to realize flexible and wearable storage devices. The most important parameters, both from the electrochemical and textile points of view, have been taken into account in order to provide, as much as possible, a standard reference for comparing different kinds of textile-based energy storage devices. These parameters include electrode fibers configuration, fiber diameter, tensile strength, capacitance, charge/discharge capacity, Coulombic efficiency and capacity retention. Furthermore, in this review textile electrodes have been classified into two categories, according to the fabrication strategies: bottom-up and top-down fabrication processes. To conclude, the main aim of this review is to provide an organic outline of the recent research progress and perspectives on textile-based energy storage devices.",

Currently, the most innovative and promising non-invasive strategy in brain delivery is the design and preparation of nanocarriers, which can move through the brain endothelium. Niosomes can perform brain delivery, in fact polysorbates, can act as an anchor for apolipoprotein E from blood plasma. The particles mimic LDL and interact with the LDL receptor leading to the endothelial cells uptake. The efficacy of niosomes for anticancer therapeutic applications was correlated to their physicochemical and drug delivery properties. Dimensions and ζ-potential were characterized using dynamic light scattering and asymmetric flow-field fractionation system. Lipid bilayer was characterized measuring the fluidity, polarity and microviscosity by fluorescent probe spectra evaluation. Morphology and homogeneity were characterized using atomic force microscopy. Physicochemical stability and serum stability (45% v/v fetal bovine and human serum) were evaluated as a function of time using dynamic light scattering. U87-MG human glioblastoma cells were used to evaluate vesicle cytotoxicity and internalisation efficiency. From the obtained data, the systems appear useful to perform a prolonged (modified) release of biological active substances to the central nervous system.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 American Chemical Society.The use of nanocarriers, which respond to different stimuli controlling their physicochemical properties and biological responsivness, shows a growing interest in pharmaceutical science. The stimuli are activated by targeting tissues and biological compartments, e.g., pH modification, temperature, redox condition, enzymatic activity, or can be physically applied, e.g., a magnetic field and ultrasound. pH modification represents the easiest method of passive targeting, which is actually used to accumulate nanocarriers in cells and tissues. The aim of this paper was to physicochemically characterize pH-sensitive niosomes using different experimental conditions and demonstrate the effect of surfactant composition on the supramolecular structure of niosomes. In this attempt, niosomes, made from commercial (Tween21) and synthetic surfactants (Tween20 derivatives), were physicochemically characterized by using different techniques, e.g., transmission electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and small-angle X-ray scattering. The changes of niosome structure at different pHs depend on surfactants, which can affect the supramolecular structure of colloidal nanocarriers and their potential use both in vitro and in vivo. At pH 7.4, the shape and structure of niosomes have been maintained; however, niosomes show some differences in terms of bilayer thicknesses, water penetration, membrane coupling, and cholesterol dispersion. The acid pH (5.5) can increase the bilayer fluidity, and affect the cholesterol depletion. In fact, Tween21 niosomes form large vesicles with lower curvature radius at acid pH; while Tween20-derivative niosomes increase the intrachain mobility within a more interchain correlated membrane. These results demonstrate that the use of multiple physicochemical procedures provides more information about supramolecular structures of niosomes and improves the opportunity to deeply investigate the effect of stimuli responsiveness on the niosome structure.",

Noise can enhance perception of tactile and proprioceptive stimuli by stochastic resonance processes. However, the mechanisms underlying this general phenomenon remain to be characterized. Here we studied how externally applied noise influences action potential firing in mouse primary sensory neurons of dorsal root ganglia, modelling a basic process in sensory perception. Since noisy mechanical stimuli may cause stochastic fluctuations in receptor potential, we examined the effects of sub-threshold depolarizing current steps with superimposed random fluctuations. We performed whole cell patch clamp recordings in cultured neurons of mouse dorsal root ganglia. Noise was added either before and during the step, or during the depolarizing step only, to focus onto the specific effects of external noise on action potential generation. In both cases, step + noise stimuli triggered significantly more action potentials than steps alone. The normalized power norm had a clear peak at intermediate noise levels, demonstrating that the phenomenon is driven by stochastic resonance. Spikes evoked in step + noise trials occur earlier and show faster rise time as compared to the occasional ones elicited by steps alone. These data suggest that external noise enhances, via stochastic resonance, the recruitment of transient voltage-gated Na channels, responsible for action potential firing in response to rapid step-wise depolarizing currents.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd. The intrinsic stochasticity of gene expression is usually mitigated in higher eukaryotes by post-transcriptional regulation channels that stabilise the output layer, most notably protein levels. The discovery of small non-coding RNAs (miRNAs) in specific motifs of the genetic regulatory network has led to identifying noise buffering as the possible key function they exert in regulation. Recent in vitro and in silico studies have corroborated this hypothesis. It is however also known that miRNA-mediated noise reduction is hampered by transcriptional bursting in simple topologies. Here, using stochastic simulations validated by analytical calculations based on van Kampen's expansion, we revisit the noise-buffering capacity of the miRNA-mediated Incoherent Feed Forward Loop (IFFL), a small module that is widespread in the gene regulatory networks of higher eukaryotes, in order to account for the effects of intermittency in the transcriptional activity of the modulator gene. We show that bursting considerably alters the circuit's ability to control static protein noise. By comparing with other regulatory architectures, we find that direct transcriptional regulation significantly outperforms the IFFL in a broad range of kinetic parameters. This suggests that, under pulsatile inputs, static noise reduction may be less important than dynamical aspects of noise and information processing in characterising the performance of regulatory elements.",

Recent annotations show that more than half of the transcriptome encodes for RNA molecules lacking coding activity. Here we illustrate how these transcripts affect skeletal muscle differentiation and related disorders. We discuss the most recent scientific discoveries that have led to the identification of the molecular circuitries that are controlled by RNA during the differentiation process and that, when deregulated, lead to pathogenic events.

ConspectusDensity functional theory (DFT) emerged in the last two decades as the most reliable tool for the description and prediction of properties of molecular systems and extended materials, coupling in an unprecedented way high accuracy and reasonable computational cost. This success rests also on the development of more and more performing density functional approximations (DFAs). Indeed, the Achilles' heel of DFT is represented by the exchange-correlation contribution to the total energy, which, being unknown, must be approximated. Since the beginning of the 1990s, global hybrids (GH) functionals, where an explicit dependence of the exchange-correlation energy on occupied Kohn-Sham orbitals is introduced thanks to a fraction of Hartree-Fock-like exchange, imposed themselves as the most reliable DFAs for chemical applications. However, if these functionals normally provide results of sufficient accuracy for most of the cases analyzed, some properties, such as thermochemistry or dispersive interactions, can still be significantly improved. A possible way out is represented by the inclusion, into the exchange-correlation functional, of an explicit dependence on virtual Kohn-Sham orbitals via perturbation theory. This leads to a new class of functionals, called double-hybrids (DHs). In this Account, we describe our nonempirical approach to DHs, which, following the line traced by the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof approach, allows for the definition of a GH (PBE0) and a DH (QIDH) model. In such a way, a whole family of nonempirical functionals, spanning on the highest rungs of the Perdew's quality scale, is now available and competitive with other - more empirical - DFAs. Discussion of selected cases, ranging from thermochemistry and reactions to weak interactions and excitation energies, not only show the large range of applicability of nonempirical DFAs, but also underline how increasing the number of theoretical constraints parallels with an improvement of the DFA's numerical performances. This fact further consolidates the strong theoretical framework of nonempirical DFAs.Finally, even if nonempirical DH approaches are still computationally expensive, relying on the fact that they can benefit of all technical enhancements developed for speeding up post-Hartree-Fock methods, there is substantial hope for their near future routine application to the description and prediction of complex chemical systems and reactions.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 American Chemical Society. The simple solution processability at room temperature exposes lead halide perovskite semiconductors to a non-negligible level of unintentional structural and chemical defects. Ascertained that their primary optoelectronic properties meet the requirement for high efficiency optoelectronic technologies, a lack of knowledge about the nature of defects and their role in the device operation currently is a major challenge for their market-scale application due to the issues with stability and reliability. Here, we use excitation correlation photoluminescence (ECPL) spectroscopy to investigate the recombination dynamics of the photogenerated carriers in lead bromide perovskites and quantitatively describe the carrier trapping dynamics within a generalization of the Shockley-Read-Hall formalism. The superior sensitivity of our spectroscopic tool to the many-body interactions enables us to identify the energetics of the defects. In fact, in the case of polycrystalline films, depending on the synthetic route, we demonstrate the presence of both deep and shallow carrier traps. The shallow defects, which are situated at about 20 meV below the conduction band, dope the semiconductor, leading to a substantial enhancement of the photoluminescence quantum yield despite carrier trapping. At excitation densities relevant for lasing, we observe breakdown of the rate-equation model, indicating a buildup of a highly correlated regime of the photocarrier population that suppresses the nonradiative Auger recombination. Furthermore, we demonstrate that colloidal nanocrystals represent virtually defect-free systems, suffering from nonradiative quenching only due to subpicosecond Auger-like interactions at high excitation density. By correlating the fabrication conditions to the nonradiative loss channels, this work provides guidelines for material engineering towards superior optoelectronic devices.",

Plasmonic nanoassemblies endowed with ultrasmall interparticle gaps display a rich and unusual electromagnetic response both in near- and far-field readout. The properties of such systems can be mainly ascribed to the hybridization of localized surface plasmon modes, which in turn enables a higher degree of field confinement with respect to single particles. Pushing these plasmonic resonances toward stronger coupling regimes (i.e., smaller gaps) requires particular attention to the microscopic description of the system. In this article, we theoretically show that the appearing of nonlocal effects in the electromagnetic response of a plasmonic dimer in a strong coupling regime unveils a natural extension of its hybridization scheme. We demonstrate the arising of a Fano resonant interference in the visible range, resulting from the interaction of a hybrid quadrupolar mode and a highly localized gap mode.",

Recent experiments in high-quality gapped graphene have highlighted a saturation of the nonlocal resistance as a function of the longitudinal charge resistivity ρc,XX, when the system is driven deep into the insulating phase. The origin of this saturation is, to date, unclear. In this work we show that this behavior is fully compatible with bulk topological transport in the regime of large valley Hall angles (VHAs). We demonstrate that, for a fixed value of the valley diffusion length, the dependence of the nonlocal resistance on ρc,XX weakens for increasing VHAs, transitioning from the standard ρc,XX3 power law to a result that is independent of ρc,XX.",

The use of a gas cell as a target for laser wakefield acceleration (LWFA) offers the possibility to obtain stable and manageable laser-plasma interaction process, a mandatory condition for practical applications of this emerging technique, especially in multi-stage accelerators. In order to obtain full control of the gas particle number density in the interaction region, thus allowing for a long term stable and manageable LWFA, real-time monitoring is necessary. In fact, the ideal gas law cannot be used to estimate the particle density inside the flow cell based on the preset backing pressure and the room temperature because the gas flow depends on several factors like tubing, regulators, and valves in the gas supply system, as well as vacuum chamber volume and vacuum pump speed/throughput. Here, second-harmonic interferometry is applied to measure the particle number density inside a flow gas cell designed for LWFA. The results demonstrate that real-time monitoring is achieved and that using low backing pressure gas (&lt;1 bar) and different cell orifice diameters (&lt;2 mm) it is possible to finely tune the number density up to the 1019 cm-3 range well suited for LWFA.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 IEEE. Transoral Laser Microsurgeries (TLM) demand a great level of control and precision in intraoperative tissue manipulation. The optimal eradication of the diseased tissue is possible only with coordinated control of the laser aiming for incision and the microsurgical tools for orienting and stretching the tissue. However, the traditional microsurgical tools are long, single purpose, one degree-of-freedom (DOF), rigid tools with small range of motion and a normal grasping handle inducing non-ergonomic usage. This paper presents a novel, modular microsurgical tool to overcome the challenges of the traditional tools and improve the surgeon-tool usage experience. The novel design adds a rotational DOF to expand the reach and functionality of the tool. The device is provided with an ergonomic grasping handle that avoids extreme wrist excursions and is capable of adapting to the variety of tools used in TLM within the same design. The performance of the new microsurgical tool was evaluated through a subjective assessment with both medical students and expert surgeons. The evaluation demonstrated a general acceptance of the new forceps tool, with the expert surgeons providing positive appraisals for the improved functionality and user experience with the tool, which indicates towards the potential suitability of the device for TLM. The parameters assessed in the preliminary evaluation not only provide a sense of the advantages of the novel design, but also guide future evolution of the tool design.",

Careful choices of the growth parameters lead to In-rich conditions such that the InAs NWs nucleate from an In droplet and grow by the vapor-liquid-solid mechanism while sustaining an In droplet at the tip. As the growth progresses, new NWs continue to nucleate on the Si (111) surface causing a spread in the NW size distribution. The observed behavior in NW nucleation and growth is described within a suitable existing theoretical model allowing us to extract relevant growth parameters. We argue that these results provide useful guidelines to rationally control the growth of self-catalyzed InAs NWs for various applications.",

The deformation and cross-streamline migration of an elastic particle in pressure-driven flows of Newtonian and viscoelastic (Oldroyd-B, Giesekus) fluids in a cylindrical tube are studied through 3D finite element method numerical simulations. The dependences of particle deformation and migration on geometric confinement, flow strength, and fluid rheology are investigated. If the particle is initially not at the channel axis, it attains an asymmetric shape and migrates. In a Newtonian liquid, the migration is always directed towards the tube axis. A project equation is proposed for the design of a microfluidic cylindrical device aimed at focusing elastic particles on the cylinder centerline. In a viscoelastic liquid, the migration direction and velocity depend on the competition among particle deformability, fluid elasticity, and fluid viscosity shear thinning (if any). In a certain range of parameters, an unstable radial position appears, which separates the region where the migration is directed towards the axis from the region where it is directed towards the wall.",

We study the dynamics of a slippery spherical particle suspended in an inertialess Newtonian or viscoelastic shear-thinning fluid, under shear or Poiseuille flow, by means of 3D direct numerical simulations. In particular, we investigate on the effect of particle slip on the cross-stream migration induced by fluid viscoelasticity. The governing equations are solved through the finite element method, by adopting an Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) formulation to handle the particle motion.In shear flow, the migration dynamics is qualitatively unchanged as compared to the no-slip case, i.e. the particle always moves toward the nearest wall regardless of the initial position. For increasing slip, the migration velocity first reaches a maximum, and then decreases to values lower than the no-slip one. Thus, a pronounced particle slip slows down the migration phenomenon.In Poiseuille flow, at variance with the no-slip case for a shear-thinning viscoelastic fluid, the tube wall becomes a 'hydrodynamic repulsor' for high slip values, and all the particles migrate toward the channel centerline ('attractor'). In this sense, slippery particles are more easily aligned along the channel centerline than no-slip particles.",

Herein, we propose for the first time a mixture of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and acetone that dissolves nylon 6,6, resulting in crystalline and non-porous films. Furthermore the same mixture of solvents was proved to be an excellent co-solvent for graphene nanoplatelets that were homogeneously dispersed in the solutions to produce reinforced nylon 6,6 polymer composites. The dispersion of the nanoplates in the polymer solution was found to be very stable over time. The mechanical and electrical properties of the developed composites were studied as a function of filler content. The Young's modulus of the nylon 6,6 films increases more than two times upon the addition of the nanoplates. Furthermore, the flexible composites exhibit semiconducting behavior, with their electrical conductivity reaching 10-2 S cm-1 for 20 wt% graphene nanoplatelet concentration.",

Moreover, these mice had reduced uptake of triglyceride (TG)-rich lipoprotein-derived fatty acids and lower levels of n-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) in the hypothalamus. Here, we asked whether increased dietary fat content or altered dietary composition could modulate obesity development in NEXLPL -/- mice. Male NEXLPL -/- mice and littermate controls (WT) were randomly assigned one of three synthetic diets; a high carbohydrate diet (HC, 10% fat), a high-fat diet (HF, 45% fat), or a HC diet supplemented with n-3 PUFAs (HCn-3, 10% fat, Lovaza, GSK®). After 42 weeks of HC feeding, body weight and fat mass were increased in the NEXLPL -/- mice compared to WT. WT mice fed a HF diet displayed typical diet-induced obesity, but weight gain was only marginal in HF-fed NEXLPL -/- mice, with no significant difference in body composition. Dietary n-3 PUFA supplementation did not prevent obesity in NEXLPL -/- mice, but was associated with differential modifications in hypothalamic gene expression and PUFA concentration compared to WT mice. Our findings suggest that neuronal LPL is involved in the regulation of body weight and composition in response to either the change in quantity (HF feeding) or quality (n-3 PUFA-enriched) of dietary fat. The precise role of LPL in lipid sensing in the brain requires further investigation.",

The development of reliable and robust visual recognition systems is a main challenge towards the deployment of autonomous robotic agents in unconstrained environments. Learning to recognize objects requires image representations that are discriminative to relevant information while being invariant to nuisances, such as scaling, rotations, light and background changes, and so forth. Deep Convolutional Neural Networks can learn such representations from large webcollected image datasets and a natural question is how these systems can be best adapted to the robotics context where little supervision is often available. In this work, we investigate different training strategies for deep architectures on a new dataset collected in a real-world robotic setting. In particular we show how deep networks can be tuned to improve invariance and discriminability properties and perform object identification tasks with minimal supervision.",

The diagnosis and monitoring of HCV infection is a crucial need in the clinical management. The conventional diagnostic technologies are challenged when trying to address molecular diagnostics, especially because they require a complex and time-consuming sample preparation phase. Here, a new concept based on surface functionalization was applied to viral RNA purification: first of all polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) flat surfaces were modified to hold RNA adsorption. After a careful chemical and morphological analysis of the modified surfaces, the functionalization protocols giving the best RNA adsorbing surfaces were applied to PDMS microdevices. The functionalized microdevices were then used for RNA purification from HCV infected human plasma samples. RNA purification and RT were successfully performed in the same microdevice chamber, saving time of analysis, reagents, and labor. The PCR protocol for HCV cDNA amplification was also implemented in the microdevice, demonstrating that the entire process of HCV analysis, from plasma to molecular readout, could be performed on-chip. Not only HCV but also other microdevice-based viral RNA detection could therefore result in a successful Point-of-Care (POC) diagnostics for resource-limited settings.",

One interface is an instrumented glove able to measure the human hand posture. The aim is the integration of the motion of robotic finger with that of the human hand so to achieve complex manipulation skills. The second interface is a ring with a push button embedded so to implement a simple and intuitive control. The presence of an extra robotic finger in human hand enlarges the workspace, increases the grasping capabilities and the manipulation dexterity. We will propose a series of grasping and manipulation tasks to be performed with the help of the robotic sixth finger and the relative interface so to prove their effectiveness in augmenting the human hand capabilities.",

However, to date, little attention has been paid to the multi-sensing abilities of this material. In this work, we present an efficient multisensor based on a single zinc oxide microwire/gold junction. The device is able to detect in real time three different stimuli, UV-VIS light, temperature and pH variations. This is thanks to three properties of zinc oxide its photoconductive response, pyroelectricity and surface functionalization with amino-propyl groups, respectively. The three stimuli can be detected either simultaneously or in a sequence/random order. A specific mathematical tool was also developed, together with a design of experiments (DoE), to predict the performances of the sensor. Our micro-device allows reliable and versatile real-time measurements of UV-VIS light, temperature and pH variations. Therefore, it shows great potential for use in the field of sensing for living cell cultures.",

The grasp height effect predicts that, when people take hold of an object to move it to a new position, the grasp height on the object is inversely related to the height of the target position. In the present study, we used this effect as a window into the prospective sensorimotor control of children with autism spectrum disorders without accompanying intellectual impairment. Participants were instructed to grasp a vertical cylinder and move it from a table (home position) to a shelf of varying height (target position). Depending on the conditions, they performed the task using only one hand (unimanual), two hands (bimanual), or with the help of a co-actor (joint). Comparison between the performance of typically developing children and children with autism revealed no group difference across tasks. We found, however, a significant influence of IQ on grasp height modulation in both groups. These results provide clear evidence against a general prospective sensorimotor planning deficit and suggest that at least some form of higher order planning is present in autism without accompanying intellectual impairment.",

The natural steroidal alkaloid cyclopamine has been identified as the first inhibitor of the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway, which is implicated in embryonic development and tumorigenesis, as well as is hyperactivated in cancer stem cells (CSCs). The list of Hh-dependent tumors is steadily growing, and it has been estimated that about 25% of all cancer deaths show signs of aberrant Hh pathway activation. Notably, cyclopamine has been found to exert anticancer activity against several types of human cancer and to inhibit CSCs proliferation, thus highlighting the druggability of the Hh pathway and paving new opportunities in anticancer drug discovery. The aim of the present work is to review the main synthetic strategies to cyclopamine and its derivatives, with particular emphasis on the challenging chemical modifications aimed at improving the biological activity of the molecule.",

This study reports a novel one-step synthesis of hybrid iron oxide/polypyrrole multifunctional nanoparticles encapsulating hydrophobic drug and decorated with polyethylene glycol. The overall process is based on the in situ chemical oxidative polymerization of pyrrole along with the reduction of ferric chloride (FeCl3) in the presence of ketoprofen as model drug and PEGylated surfactants. The final product is a nanocomposite composed of polypyrrole and a mixture of FeO/Fe2O3. Different concentrations of ketoprofen were encapsulated in the nanocomposite, and were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Encapsulation efficiency of the final product was measured by absorption, which can reach up to 98%. The release experiments confirmed complete drug release after about 3 h in PBS solution. Morphological characterization of the nanocomposites was performed by electron microscopy (scanning and transmission electron microscopy) which confirmed the spherical geometry and opaque nature of nanoparticles with average particle size well below 50 nm. The final product is multifunctional system, which could act both as a nanocarrier for drug molecules as well as a contrasting agent. Magnetic relaxometry studies confirmed their possible applications as potential contrast agent in the field of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).",

The thresholding of Surface ElectroMyoGraphic (sEMG) signals, i.e., Average Threshold Crossing (ATC) technique, reduces the amount of data to be processed enabling circuit complexity reduction and low power consumption. This paper investigates the lowest level of complexity reachable by an ATC system through measurements and in-vivo experiments with an embedded prototype for wireless force transmission, based on asynchronous Impulse-Radio Ultra Wide Band (IR-UWB). The prototype is composed by the acquisition unit, a wearable PCB 23 × 34 mm, which includes a full custom IC integrating a UWB transmitter (chip active silicon area 0.016 mm2, 1 mW power consumption), and the receiver. The system is completely asynchronous, it acquires a differential sEMG signal, generates the ATC events and triggers a 3.3 GHz IR-UWB transmission. ATC robustness relaxes filters constraints: two passive first order filters have been implemented, bandwidth from 10 Hz up to 1 kHz. Energy needed for the single pulse generation is 30 pJ while the whole PCB consumes 5.65 mW. The pulses radiated by the acquisition unit TX are received by a short-range and low complexity threshold-based 130 nm CMOS IR-UWB receiver with an Ultra Low Power (ULP) baseband unit capable of robustly receiving generic quasi-digital pulse sequences. The acquisition unit have been tested with 10 series of in vivo isometric and isotonic contractions, while the transmission channel with over-the-air and cable measurements obtained with a couple of planar monopole antennas and an integrated 0.004 mm2 transmitter, the same used for the acquisition unit, with realistic channel conditions. The entire system, acquisition unit and receiver, consumes 15.49 mW.",

Nonetheless, the lack of haptic feedback during laser cutting impairs the surgeon's perception of the incision depth, potentially leading to undesired tissue damage. Methods: This paper presents a novel approach, based on statistical regression analysis, to estimate the laser incision depth in soft tissue. User trials were conducted in a laser surgery set-up, to verify the effectiveness of online estimation of incision depth in supporting precise tissue cutting. Results: The estimation accuracy was verified on ex vivo muscle tissue, revealing a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.1mm for depths ranging up to 1.4mm. Online estimation of depth has the potential to significantly improve the incision control of users. Conclusions: The proposed approach was successful in producing estimations of laser cutting depth in ex vivo muscle tissue. Further investigation is required to validate this approach on other types of tissue. Providing depth estimation during laser cutting allows users to perform more precise incisions.",

One of the main outcomes of this paper is that position terms in control laws are replaced by parametrized terms. Stability and convergence of time-varying reference trajectories obtained with the proposed method are demonstrated to be in the sense of Lyapunov.

            "abstract": "© 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. Even though it is recognized that vision plays an important role in grasping movements, it is not yet fully understood how the visual feedback of the hand contributes to the on-line control. Visual feedback could be used to shape the posture of the hand and fingers, to adjust the trajectory of the moving hand, or a combination of both. Here, we used a dynamic perturbation method that altered the position of the visual feedback relative to the actual position of the thumb and index finger to virtually increase or decrease the visually sensed grip aperture. Subjects grasped objects in a virtual 3D environment with haptic feedback and with visual feedback provided by small virtual spheres anchored to the their unseen fingertips. We found that the effects of the visually perturbed grip aperture arose preeminently late in the movement when the hand was in the object’s proximity. The on-line visual feedback assisted both the scaling of the grip aperture to properly conform it to the object’s dimension and the transport of the hand to correctly position the digits on the object’s surface. However, the extent of these compensatory adjustments was contingent on the viewing geometry. The visual control of the actual grip aperture was mainly observed when the final grasp axis orientation was approximately perpendicular to the viewing direction. On the contrary, when the final grasp axis was aligned with the viewing direction, the visual control was predominantly concerned with the guidance of the digit toward the visible final contact point.",

            "abstract": "© 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.In spite of the detailed information provided by advanced time-resolved spectroscopy, the understanding of the excited-state proton transfer (ESPT) reactivity remains difficult to obtain at molecular level. In this work we studied three photoacids showing different strength: the 8-hydroxy-1,3,6-pyrenetrisulfonate weak photoacid, the N-methyl-6-hydroxyquinolinium strong photoacid and the phenol-carboxyether dipicolinium cyanine (QCy9) superphotoacid, focusing on the intermolecular ESPT toward a solvent molecule or a base molecule in aqueous solution. To this aim, the ground and the first singlet excited-state potential energy surfaces of the three systems were characterized by means of the time-dependent density functional theory and a hybrid implicit/explicit model of the solvent. Main structural and photophysical features of the photoacids were assessed and satisfactorily compared with the experimental data. Energy profiles along the PT coordinate were analyzed in both the electronic states. We reproduced many important features of the photoacidity experimentally observed. The results suggest that the relative strength is mainly due to the different extent of charge transfer caused by the electronic transition in proximity of the acid group. Remarkably, we found that even in the case of the strongest photoacid (QCy9), showing a ESPT rate as rapid as to escape the solvent dynamics control, the PT is modulated and supported by the first solvation shell of the proton-accepting molecule. However, a complete understanding of this fascinating field needs the full account for the electronic and the molecular dynamics in play at different timescales.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 American Chemical Society.We simulated the intrinsic reaction path of the Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) proton shuttle in both the ground state (S0) and first singlet excited state (S1), accounting for the main energetic and steric effects of the protein in a convenient model including the chromophore, the crystallographic water, and the residues directly involved in the proton transfer event. We adopted density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) levels to define the potential energy surfaces of the two electronic states, and we compared results obtained by the Damped Velocity Verlet and the Hessian-based Predictor-Corrector integrators of the intrinsic reaction coordinate, which gave a comparable and consistent picture of the mechanism. We show that, at S1, the GFP proton transfer becomes favored, with respect to S0, as suggested by the experimental evidence. As an important finding, this change is strictly related to the rearrangement of the hydrogen bond network composing the reaction path, which, in S1, relaxes to a tighter and planar configuration, as a consequence of the photoinduced relaxation in the GFP chromophore structure, thus prompting more effectively for the proton shuttle. Therefore, we give an unprecedented direct proof of the key role played by the photoinduced structural relaxation of the GFP on the chromophore photoacidity, validating, in particular, the hypothesis of Fang and co-workers [Nature 2009, 462, 200].",

(poly(N-9′-heptadecanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt -5,5-(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole))) in relation to unintentionally formed main chain defects are investigated. Carbazole–carbazole homocouplings (Cbz hc) are found to significant extent in PCDTBT made with a variety of Suzuki polycondensation conditions. Cbz hc vary between 0 and 8 mol% depending on the synthetic protocol used, and are quantified by detailed nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy including model compounds, which allows to establish a calibration curve from optical spectroscopy. The results are corroborated by extended time-dependent density functional theory investigations on the structural, electronic, and optical properties of regularly alternating and homocoupled chains. The photovoltaic properties of PCDTBT:fullerene blend solar cells significantly depend on the Cbz hc content for constant molecular weight, whereby an increasing amount of Cbz hc leads to strongly decreased short circuit currents JSC. With increasing Cbz hc content, JSC decreases more strongly than the intensity of the low energy absorption band, suggesting that small losses in absorption cannot explain the decrease in JSC alone, rather than combined effects of a more localized LUMO level on the TBT unit and lower hole mobilities found in highly defective samples. Homocoupling-free PCDTBT with optimized molecular weight yields the highest efficiency up to 7.2% without extensive optimization.",

However, the correlation between such a hedonic aspect of touch and the Autonomic Nervous System (ANS)-related physiological response, which is intimately connected to emotions, still needs to be deeply investigated. This study reports on caress-like stimuli conveyed to the forearm of 32 healthy subjects through different fabrics actuated by a haptic device, which can control both the strength (i.e. the normal force exerted by the fabric) and the velocity of the elicitation. The mimicked caresses were elicited with a fixed force of 6 N, two levels of velocity of 9.4 mm/sec and 65 mm/sec, and four different fabrics with different textures: burlap, hemp, velvet and silk. Participants were asked to score the caress-like stimuli in terms of arousal and valence through a self-assessment questionnaire. Heartbeat data related to the perceived most pleasant (silk) and unpleasant (burlap) fabrics were used as an input to an automatic pattern recognition procedure. Accordingly, considering gender differences, support vector machines using features extracted from linear and nonlinear heartbeat dynamics showed a recognition accuracy of 84.38% (men) and 78.13% (women) while discerning between burlap and silk elicitations at the higher velocity. Results suggest that the fabrics used for the caress-like stimulation significantly affect the nonlinear cardiovascular dynamics, also showing differences according to gender.",

Moving objects with autonomous robots is a wide topic that includes single-arm pick-and-place tasks, object regrasping, object passing between two or more arms in the air or using support surfaces such as tables and similar. Each task has been extensively studied and many planning solutions are already present in the literature. In this letter, we present a planning scheme which, based on the use of pre-defined elementary manipulation skills, aims to unify solutions which are usually obtained by means of different planning strategies rooted on hard-coded behaviors. Both robotic manipulators and environment fixed support surfaces are treated as end-effectors of movable and non-movable types, respectively. The task of the robot can thus be broken down into elementary building blocks, which are end-effector manipulation skills, that are then planned at the kinematic level. Feasibility is ensured by propagating unforeseen low-level failures at the higher level and by synthesizing different behaviors. The validity of the proposed solution is shown via experiments on a bimanual robot setup and in simulations involving a more complex setup similar to an assembly line.",

Its robustness is proved via the production of nanodiamonds powders at room-temperature and standard atmospheric pressure by pulsed laser ablation of pyrolytic graphite in water. The aqueous environment provides a confinement mechanism that promotes diamond nucleation and growth, and a biologically compatible medium for suspension of nanodiamonds. Moreover, we introduce a facile physico-chemical method that does not require harsh chemical or temperature conditions to remove the graphitic byproducts of the laser ablation process. A full characterization of the nanodiamonds by electron and Raman spectroscopies is reported. Our model is also corroborated by comparison with experimental data from the literature.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 Journal of Visualized Experiments. Hybrid interfaces between organic semiconductors and living tissues represent a new tool for in-vitro and in-vivo applications. In particular, conjugated polymers display several optimal properties as substrates for biological systems, such as good biocompatibility, excellent mechanical properties, cheap and easy processing technology, and possibility of deposition on light, thin and flexible substrates. These materials have been employed for cellular interfaces like neural probes, transistors for excitation and recording of neural activity, biosensors and actuators for drug release. Recent experiments have also demonstrated the possibility to use conjugated polymers for all-optical modulation of the electrical activity of cells. Several in-vitro study cases have been reported, including primary neuronal networks, astrocytes and secondary line cells. Moreover, signal photo-transduction mediated by organic polymers has been shown to restore light sensitivity in degenerated retinas, suggesting that these devices may be used for artificial retinal prosthesis in the future. All in all, light sensitive conjugated polymers represent a new approach for optical modulation of cellular activity. In this work, all the steps required to fabricate a bio-polymer interface for optical excitation of living cells are described. The function of the active interface is to transduce the light stimulus into a modulation of the cell membrane potential. As a study case, useful for in-vitro studies, a polythiophene thin film is used as the functional, light absorbing layer, and Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK-293) cells are employed as the biological component of the interface. Practical examples of successful control of the cell membrane potential upon stimulation with light pulses of different duration are provided. In particular, it is shown that both depolarizing and hyperpolarizing effects on the cell membrane can be achieved depending on the duration of the light stimulus. The reported protocol is of general validity and can be straightforwardly extended to other biological preparations.",

Notwithstanding their structural similarity to carbon nanotubes (CNTs), they possess remarkably different physical and chemical properties, which make them attractive for a wide range of applications. In this chapter, an account on the electronic and optical properties of BNNTs is given. Particular attention will be devoted to nonlinear optical effects, which lead to large second-order susceptibilities and therefore to strong second-harmonic and sum-frequency generation when excited with pulsed lasers. This peculiarity, absent in CNTs, was recently exploited to investigate the internalization of BNNTs by cells in a completely label-free-microscopy approach paving the way to further studies without the need for complex surface functionalization with fluorophores that can alter the biological behavior of the tubes and limit, due to photobleaching, the available observation time.",

We design and experimentally demonstrate a plasmonic optical vortex emitter, based on a metal-insulator-metal holey plasmonic vortex lens. Our plasmonic element is shown to convert impinging circularly polarized light to an orbital angular momentum state capable of propagating to the far-field. Moreover, the emerging OAM can be externally adjusted by switching the handedness of the incident light polarization. The device has a radius of few micrometers and the OAM beam is generated from subwavelength aperture. The fabrication of integrated arrays of PVLs and the possible simultaneous emission of multiple optical vortices provide an easy way to the large-scale integration of optical vortex emitters for wide-ranging applications.",

These requirements are usually attained with a controlled chemical/biochemical functionalization that creates a stable layer on a sensor surface. In this work, a chemical modification protocol for silicon-based surfaces to be applied in biosensing devices is presented. An anhydrous silanization step through 3-aminopropylsilane (APTES), followed by a further derivatization with succinic anhydride (SA), is optimized to generate an ordered flat layer of carboxylic groups. The properties of APTES/SA modified surface were compared with a functionalization in which glutaraldehyde (GA) is used as crosslinker instead of SA, in order to have a comparison with an established and largely applied procedure. Moreover, a functionalization based on the controlled deposition of a plasma polymerized acrylic acid (PPAA) thin film was used as a reference for carboxylic reactivity. Advantages and drawbacks of the considered methods are highlighted, through physico-chemical characterizations (OCA, XPS, and AFM) and by means of a functional Protein G/Antibody immunoassay. These analyses reveal that the most homogeneous, reproducible and active surface is achieved by using the optimized APTES/SA coupling.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 American Association for Clinical Chemistry. Background: The identification of circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) in the blood has been recently exploited for the development of minimally invasive tests for the early detection of cancer. Nevertheless, the clinical transferability of such tests is uncertain due to still-insufficient standardization and optimization of methods to detect circulating miRNAs in the clinical setting. METHODS: We performed a series of tests to optimize the quantification of serum miRNAs that compose the miR-Test, a signature for lung cancer early detection, and systematically analyzed variables that could affect the performance of the test. We took advantage of a large-scale (1000 samples) validation study of the miR-Test that we recently published, to evaluate, in clinical samples, the effects of analytical and preanalytical variables on the quantification of circulating miRNAs and the clinical output of the signature (risk score). RESULTS: We developed a streamlined and standardized pipeline for the processing of clinical serum samples that allows the isolation and analysis of circulating miRNAs by quantitative reverse-transcription PCR, with a throughput compatible with screening trials. The major source of analytical variation came from RNA isolation from serum, which could be corrected by use of external (spike-in) or endogenous miRNAs as a reference for normalization. We also introduced standard operating procedures and QC steps to check for unspecific fluctuations that arise from the lack of standardized criteria in the collection or handling of the samples (preanalytical factors). CONCLUSIONS: We propose our methodology as a reference for the development of clinical-grade blood tests on the basis of miRNA detection.",

However, the CG model landscape is variegated: even considering a given resolution level, the force fields are very heterogeneous and optimized with very different parametrization procedures. Along the road for standardization of CG models for biopolymers, here we describe a strategy to aid building and optimization of statistics based analytical force fields and its implementation in the software package AsParaGS (Assisted Parameterization platform for coarse Grained modelS). Our method is based on the use and optimization of analytical potentials, optimized by targeting internal variables statistical distributions by means of the combination of different algorithms (i.e., relative entropy driven stochastic exploration of the parameter space and iterative Boltzmann inversion). This allows designing a custom model that endows the force field terms with a physically sound meaning. Furthermore, the level of transferability and accuracy can be tuned through the choice of statistical data set composition. The method - illustrated by means of applications to helical polypeptides - also involves the analysis of two and three variable distributions, and allows handling issues related to the FF term correlations. AsParaGS is interfaced with general-purpose molecular dynamics codes and currently implements the \"minimalist\" subclass of CG models (i.e., one bead per amino acid, Cα based). Extensions to nucleic acids and different levels of coarse graining are in the course.",

This clustering reveals 2 independent neural populations, whose members interconnect only within their cluster-community and through a relay group of inter-cluster connections.

In this work we review computational approaches, based on the finite-difference time domain (FDTD) method, that allow optimizing 1D and 2D grating couplers in order to maximize the coupling efficiency with respect to the various structural parameters. In general, we find that the gap between the performance of 1D and 2D grating couplers can be reduced with proper optimization.

KGaA, Weinheim Control over the organization of assemblies from molecular dimensions up to the macroscopic length scale is an outstanding challenge in science, above all for materials in high dilution. Instead of inducing order by generating very long and stiff structures, an alternative approach is studied: a two-component assembly of a semiflexible polymer with a (self-assembling) chromonic liquid crystal. By following the structure formation in time using different techniques, a mechanistic model is proposed that explains how such unusually well-defined materials can be created from flexible components. It is concluded that at this very low concentration (&gt;99.6% water), these macroscopically organized structures can only be formed when the energies between different assembly states and their interconversion rates are properly balanced. This may, however, be in reach for a wide range of materials, which makes this a generic route toward high definition at low concentration without the need for long and rigid building blocks.",

According to the recent developments in imaging strategies and in tailoring fluorescent molecule as probe for monitoring biological systems, we coupled a Bodipy-based molecular rotor (BoMe) with FLIM phasor approach to evaluate the viscosity in different intracellular domains. BoMe rapidly permeates cells, stains cytoplasmic as well as nuclear domains, and its optical properties make it perfectly suited for widely diffused confocal microscopy imaging setups. The capability of BoMe to report on intracellular viscosity was put to the test by using a cellular model of a morbid genetic pathology (Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome, HGPS). Our results show that the nucleoplasm of HGPS cells display reduced viscosity as compared to normal cells. Since BoMe displays significant affinity towards DNA, as demonstrated by an in vitro essay, we hypothesize that genetic features of HGPS, namely the misassembly of lamin A protein within the nuclear lamina, modulates chromatin compaction. This hypothesis nicely agrees with literature data.",

            "abstract": "Scientists have identified turgor-based actuation as a fundamental mechanism in plant movements. Plant cell turgor is generated by water influx due to the osmolyte concentration gradient through the cell wall and the plasma membrane behaving as an osmotic barrier. Previous studies have focused on turgor modulation with respect to potassium chloride (KCl) concentration changes, although KCl is not efficiently retained in the cell, and many other compounds, including L-glutamine (L-Gln) and D-glucose (D-Glc), are present in the cytosol. In fact, the contributions of other osmolytes to turgor dynamics remain to be elucidated. Here, we show the association of osmolytes and their consequent cooperative effects on the time-dependent turgor profile generated in a model cytosol consisting of KCl, D-Glc and L-Gln at experimentally measured plant motor/generic cell concentrations and at modified concentrations. We demonstrate the influence and association of the osmolytes using osmometry and NMR measurements. We also show, using a plant cell-inspired device we previously developed, that osmolyte complexes, rather than single osmolytes, permit to obtain higher turgor required by plant movements. We provide quantitative cues for deeper investigations of osmolyte transport for plant movement, and reveal the possibility of developing osmotic actuators exploiting a dynamically varying concentration of osmolytes.",

Despite significant advances in contrast enhanced-magnetic resonance angiography, the lack of truly blood-pool agents with long circulating property is limiting the clinical impact of this imaging technique. The terminal half-life for blood elimination of most small molecular weight gadolinium (Gd) based extracellular fluid agents is about 1.5 h when administered intravenously to subjects with normal renal function. The small size of these extracellular fluid agents does not prevent them from extravasating, especially from damaged vessels which are generally hyperpermeable. Therefore, the development of novel, clinically relevant blood pool contrast agents is critically needed to improve outcomes in the prevention, detection, and treatment of vascular diseases. We have demonstrated the fusion strategies in which the Gd-liposome without any stealth property radically fuses with red blood cells (RBCs) forming MR glowing Gd-RBC with the order of magnitude enhancements in circulation half-life (t1/2 = 50 h) and r1 relaxivity (r1 = 19.0 mM-1 s-1) of Gd. The in vivo contrast enhancement of Gd-RBC was studied by using 3T clinical MR scanner for extended period of time, which clearly visualized the abdominal aorta. In summary, the vascular delivery of blood pool agents may benefit from carriage by RBCs because it naturally stays within the vascular lumen.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 IEEE.A growing attention has been recently devoted to the impact of the underwater noise field generated by shipping activities on the marine fauna. A key aspect for the quantification of such impact is a proper model of the source levels radiated from the vessels. At a first level of approximation, simplified formulations based on a small number of macroparameters describing the ship characteristics are needed to quantify the emission and, accordingly, assess the noise impact and evaluate strategies for its control. In fact, a few models of this kind are available in the literature, mainly based on measurements and databases developed for military purposes. Most of these models have been tuned on old ships: this poses the question whether they are still applicable to modern commercial vessels. In this work, spectra of a series of measurements of underwater noise emitted by commercial vessels measured in the framework of two EU FP7 projects (SILENV: www.silenv.eu and AQUO: www.aquo.eu) are analyzed and compared with the results obtained applying the available literature models. The analysis is carried out for noise emitted both at design and off-design conditions. In such conditions, the models are also compared with a proposed spectral parametrization. Focusing on the off-design conditions, a detailed narrow band analysis of a complete set of noise spectra is presented for a ship equipped with a controllable pitch propeller (CPP). The spectral peculiarities of such a propulsion plant, when operated at constant revolutions per minute (RPM) are highlighted. Results of the suggested parametrization applied to the same ship are presented together with the data of other CPP ships and a critical analysis is carried out discussing the limits of the existing predictive models.",

We report a coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulation study of a bundle of parallelactin filaments under supercritical conditions pressing against a loaded mobile wall using aparticle-based approach where each particle represents an actin unit. The filaments are graftedto a fixed wall at one end and are reactive at the other end, where they can perform singlemonomer (de)polymerization steps and push on a mobile obstacle. We simulate a reactive grandcanonical ensemble in a box of fixed transverse area A, with a fixed number of grafted filaments Nf ,at temperature T and monomer chemical potential μ1. For a single filament case (Nf=1) and fora bundle of Nf = 8 filaments, we analyze the structural and dynamical properties at equilibriumwhere the external load compensates the average force exerted by the bundle. The dynamics of thebundle-moving-wall unit are characteristic of an over-damped Brownian oscillator in agreementwith recent in vitro experiments by an optical trap setup. We analyze the influence of thepressing wall on the kinetic rates of (de)polymerization events for the filaments. Both static anddynamic results compare reasonably well with recent theoretical treatments of the same system.Thus, we consider the proposed model as a good tool to investigate the properties of a bundle ofliving filaments.",

Neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have increased over the last few decades. These neurodevelopmental disorders are characterized by a complex etiology, which involves multiple genes and gene-environmental interactions. Various genes that control specific properties of neural development exert pivotal roles in the occurrence and severity of phenotypes associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. Moreover, paternal aging has been reported as one of the factors that contribute to the risk of ASD and ADHD. Here we report, for the first time, that paternal aging has profound effects on the onset of behavioral abnormalities in mice carrying a mutation of Pax6, a gene with neurodevelopmental regulatory functions. We adopted an in vitro fertilization approach to restrict the influence of additional factors. Comprehensive behavioral analyses were performed in Sey/+ mice (i.e., Pax6 mutant heterozygotes) born from in vitro fertilization of sperm taken from young or aged Sey/+ fathers. No body weight changes were found in the four groups, i.e., Sey/+ and wild type (WT) mice born to young or aged father. However, we found important differences in maternal separation-induced ultrasonic vocalizations of Sey/+ mice born from young father and in the level of hyperactivity of Sey/+ mice born from aged fathers in the open-field test, respectively, compared to WT littermates. Phenotypes of anxiety were observed in both genotypes born from aged fathers compared with those born from young fathers. No significant difference was found in social behavior and sensorimotor gating among the four groups. These results indicate that mice with a single genetic risk factor can develop different phenotypes depending on the paternal age. Our study advocates for serious considerations on the role of paternal aging in breeding strategies for animal studies.",

Histone post-translational modifications (hPTMs) generate a complex combinatorial code that has been implicated with various pathologies, including cancer. Dissecting such a code in physiological and diseased states may be exploited for epigenetic biomarker discovery, but hPTM analysis in clinical samples has been hindered by technical limitations. Here, we developed a method (PAThology tissue analysis of Histones by Mass Spectrometry - PAT-H-MS) that allows to perform a comprehensive, unbiased and quantitative MS-analysis of hPTM patterns on formalinfixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples. In pairwise comparisons, histone extracted from formalin-fixed paraffinembedded tissues showed patterns similar to fresh frozen samples for 24 differentially modified peptides from histone H3. In addition, when coupled with a histone-focused version of the super-SILAC approach, this method allows the accurate quantification of modification changes among breast cancer patient samples. As an initial application of the PAThology tissue analysis of Histones by Mass Spectrometry method, we analyzed breast cancer samples, revealing significant changes in histone H3 methylation patterns among Luminal A-like and Triple Negative disease subtypes. These results pave the way for retrospective epigenetic studies that combine the power of MS-based hPTM analysis with the extensive clinical information associated with formalinfixed paraffin-embedded archives.",

The present work has the objective to investigate pectin-coated BNNTs (P-BNNTs) for their biocompatibility on macrophage cultures, since these cells are among the first components of the immune system to interact with administered nanoparticles. Methods As first step, the potential toxicity of P-BNNTs is verified in terms of proliferation, oxidative stress induction and apoptosis/necrosis phenomena. Thereafter, the modulation of immune cell response following P-BNNT exposure is evaluated at gene and protein level, in particular focusing on cytokine release. Finally, P-BNNT internalization is assessed through transmission electron microscopy and confocal microscopy. Results The results proved that P-BNNTs are not toxic for macrophages up to 50 μg/ml after 24 h of incubation. The cytokine expression is not affected by P-BNNT administration both at gene and protein level. Moreover, P-BNNTs are internalized by macrophages without impairments of the cell structures. Conclusions Collected data suggest that P-BNNTs cause neither adverse effects nor inflammation processes in macrophages. General significance These findings represent the first and fundamental step in immune compatibility evaluation of BNNTs, mandatory before any further pre-clinical testing.",

Gold nanorods (AuNRs) are eligible for a variety of biological applications including cell imaging, sensing, and photothermal therapy thanks to their optical properties. The aim of this work is to show how AuNRs could be employed as non-photobleachable optical contrast agents for biomedical applications. In order to demonstrate the feasibility of their use as optical trackers, we employed two-photon emission confocal microscopy on cells incubated with PEGylated AuNRs. Remarkably, AuNRs were localized mostly in the perinuclear zone and microscopy characterization showed the presence of a considerable number of rods inside cell nuclei. Furthermore, we estimated the toxicity and the efficiency of cellular uptake of the PEGylated AuNRs as a function of administered dose on HeLa/3T3 cell lines and on zebrafish during development, employed as an in vivo model. Eventually, we observed good agreement between in vivo and in vitro experiments. The employed AuNRs were prepared through a photochemical protocol here improved by tuning the amount of the cationic surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium bromide for the achievement of AuNRs at two different aspect ratios. Furthermore we also investigated if the AuNR aspect ratio influenced the toxicity and the efficiency of cellular uptake of the PEGylated AuNRs in HeLa/3T3 cell lines and in zebrafish embryos.",

However, the actual motor system contribution to these time distortions is far from clear. In this study we investigated visual time perception during preparation of isometric contractions and real movements of the hand in two different directions (right/left). Comparable modulations of visual event-timing are found in the isometric and in the movement condition, excluding explanations based on movement-induced sensory masking or attenuation. Most importantly, and surprisingly, visual time depends on the movement direction, being expanded for hand movements pointing away from the body and compressed in the other direction. Furthermore, the effect of movement direction is not constant, but rather undergoes non-monotonic modulations in the brief moments preceding movement initiation. Our findings indicate that time distortions are strongly linked to the motor system, and they may be unavoidable consequences of the mechanisms subserving sensory-motor integration.",

            "abstract": "© 2015 Taylor and Francis. It is very common with molecular dynamics and other simulation techniques to apply Lees-Edwards periodic boundary conditions (PBCs) for the simulation of shear flow. However, the behaviour of a complex liquid can be quite different under extensional flow. Simple deformation of a simulation cell and its periodic images only allows for simulations of these flows with short duration. For the simulation of planar extensional flow, it was recognised that the PBCs of Kraynik and Reinelt [Int. J. Multiphase Flow 1992;18:1045] could be used to perform simulations of this flow with arbitrary duration. However, a very common extensional flow in industrial applications and experiment is uniaxial extensional flow. Kraynik and Reinelt found that their method could not be directly generalised to this flow because of the lack of a lattice which reproduces itself during uniaxial extension. PBCs are presented in this article, which avoid this problem by finding a lattice which is compatible with the flow, finding the reduced basis to the lattice at all times and using this basis when calculating the position and separation of particles. Using these new PBCs, we perform nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations of a simple liquid and show that the technique gives results which agree with those from simulations using simply deforming PBCs.",

In the present paper we present ways to modulate the periodic transmission peaks arising in disordered one dimensional photonic structures with hundreds of layers. Disordered structures in which the optical length nd (n is the refractive index and d the layer thickness) is the same for each layer show regular peaks in their transmission spectra. A proper variation of the optical length of the layers leads to a splitting of the transmission peaks. Notably, the variation of the occurrence of high and low refractive index layers, gives a tool to tune also the width of the peaks. These results are of highest interest for optical application, such as light filtering, where the manifold of parameters allows a precise design of the spectral transmission ranges.",

This paper investigates a biologically motivated model of peripersonal space through its implementation on a humanoid robot. Guided by the present understanding of the neurophysiology of the fronto-parietal system, we developed a computational model inspired by the receptive fields of polymodal neurons identified, for example, in brain areas F4 and VIP. The experiments on the iCub humanoid robot show that the peripersonal space representation i) can be learned efficiently and in real-time via a simple interaction with the robot, ii) can lead to the generation of behaviors like avoidance and reaching, and iii) can contribute to the understanding the biological principle of motor equivalence. More specifically, with respect to i) the present model contributes to hypothesizing a learning mechanisms for peripersonal space. In relation to point ii) we show how a relatively simple controller can exploit the learned receptive fields to generate either avoidance or reaching of an incoming stimulus and for iii) we show how the robot can select arbitrary body parts as the controlled endpoint of an avoidance or reaching movement.",

Excimers are evanescent quasi-particles that typically form during collisional intermolecular interactions and exist exclusively for their excited-state lifetime. We exploited the distinctive structure of metal quantum clusters to fabricate permanent excimer-like colloidal superstructures made of ground-state noninteracting gold cores, held together by a network of hydrogen bonds between their capping ligands. This previously unknown aggregation state of matter, studied through spectroscopic experiments and ab initio calculations, conveys the photophysics of excimers into stable nanoparticles, which overcome the intrinsic limitation of excimers in single-particle applications - that is, their nearly zero formation probability in ultra-diluted solutions. In vitro experiments demonstrate the suitability of the superstructures as nonresonant intracellular probes and further reveal their ability to scavenge reactive oxygen species, which enhances their potential as anticytotoxic agents for biomedical applications.",

When nanoparticles (NPs) are dispersed in a biofluid, they are covered by a protein corona the composition of which strongly depends on the protein source. Recent studies demonstrated that the type of disease has a crucial role in the protein composition of the NP corona with relevant implications on personalized medicine. Proteomic variations frequently occur in cancer with the consequence that the bio-identity of NPs in the blood of cancer patients may differ from that acquired after administration to healthy volunteers. In this study we investigated the correlation between alterations of plasma proteins in breast, gastric and pancreatic cancer and the biological identity of clinically approved AmBisome-like liposomes as determined by a combination of dynamic light scattering, zeta potential analysis, one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (1D-SDS-PAGE) and semi-quantitative densitometry. While size of liposome-protein complexes was not significantly different between cancer groups, the hard corona from pancreatic cancer patients was significantly less negatively charged. Of note, the hard corona from pancreatic cancer patients was more enriched than those of other cancer types this enrichment being most likely due to IgA and IgG with possible correlations with the autoantibodies productions in cancer. Given the strict relationship between tumor antigen-specific autoantibodies and early cancer detection, our results could be the basis for the development of novel nanoparticle-corona-based screening tests of cancer.",

Unlike static cameras, where the views are often restricted or zoomed out and occlusions are common scenarios, first-person-views (FPVs) or ego-centric views see people closely and mostly get un-occluded face images. In this paper, we propose a face re-identification framework designed for a network of multiple wearable devices. This framework utilizes a global data association method termed as Network Consistent Reidentification (NCR) that not only helps in maintaining consistency in association results across the network, but also improves the pair-wise face re-identification accuracy. To test the proposed pipeline, we collected a database of FPV videos of 72 persons using multiple wearable devices (such as Google Glasses) in a multi-storied office environment. Experimental results indicate that NCR is able to consistently achieve large performance gains when compared to the state-of-the-art methodologies.",

Nowadays, surveillance cameras with high frame rate are capable of capturing several consecutive frames from each person. Multi-shot images provide richer information of the target person compared to a single-shot image. They, however, produce a high cost of information redundancy which may degrade the performance of re-identification systems. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that combines sparse coding and manifold constraints to extract discriminative information from multi-shot images of one pedestrian for person re-identification across a set of non-overlapped surveillance cameras. The evaluation over two standard multi-shot datasets shows very competitive accuracy of our framework against the state-of-the-art.",

We have found that the image can be conveniently considered and modeled in terms of the Wigner distribution function (WDF) of the object transmission. The WDF of the object has a simple physical interpretation for the case of a slowly varying object. Basically, the image intensity is the spatial marginal of the spatial convolution of the object WDF with the phase space imager kernel (PSIkernel), a rotated version of the transmission cross-coefficient. The PSI-kernel can be regarded as a partially-coherent generalization of the point spread function. This approach can be extended to consider the partial coherence of the image itself. In particular, we can consider the mutual intensity, WDF or ambiguity function of the image. It is important to note that the spatial convolution of the object WDF with the PSI-kernel is not a WDF, and not the WDF of the image. The phase space representations of the image have relevance to phase reconstruction methods such as phase space tomography, or the transport of intensity equation approach, and to the three-dimensional image properties.",

Monitoring the size and number of organelles in live cells is relevant for many applications but can be challenging due to their highly heterogeneous properties. Image correlation spectroscopy is a well-established analysis method capable of extracting the average size and number of particles in images. However, when image correlation spectroscopy is applied to a highly heterogeneous system, it can fail to retrieve, from a single correlation function, the characteristic size and the relative amount associated to each subspecies. Here, we describe a fast, unbiased, and fit-free algorithm based on the phasor analysis of multiple local image correlation functions, capable of mapping the sizes of elements contained in a heterogeneous system. The method correctly provides the size and number of separate subspecies, which otherwise would be hidden in the average properties of a single correlation function. We apply the method to quantify the spatial and temporal heterogeneity in the size and number of intracellular vesicles formed after endocytosis in live cells.",

The long-term reliability of neural interfaces and stability of high-quality recordings are still unsolved issues in neuroscience research. High surface area PEDOT-PSS-CNT composites are able to greatly improve the performance of recording and stimulation for traditional intracortical metal microelectrodes by decreasing their impedance and increasing their charge transfer capability. This enhancement significantly reduces the size of the implantable device though preserving excellent electrical performances. On the other hand, the presence of nanomaterials often rises concerns regarding possible health hazards, especially when considering a clinical application of the devices. For this reason, we decided to explore the problem from a new perspective by designing and testing an innovative device based on nanostructured microspheres grown on a thin tether, integrating PEDOT-PSS-CNT nanocomposites with a soft synthetic permanent biocompatible hydrogel. The pHEMA hydrogel preserves the electrochemical performance and high quality recording ability of PEDOT-PSS-CNT coated devices, reduces the mechanical mismatch between soft brain tissue and stiff devices and also avoids direct contact between the neural tissue and the nanocomposite, by acting as a biocompatible protective barrier against potential nanomaterial detachment. Moreover, the spherical shape of the electrode together with the surface area increase provided by the nanocomposite deposited on it, maximize the electrical contact and may improve recording stability over time. These results have a good potential to contribute to fulfill the grand challenge of obtaining stable neural interfaces for long-term applications.",

            "abstract": "Copyright © 2016 ISCA.This paper proposes an approach, named phonetic context embedding, to model phonetic context effects for deep neural network-hidden Markov model (DNN-HMM) phone recognition. Phonetic context embeddings can be regarded as continuous and distributed vector representations of context-dependent phonetic units (e.g., triphones). In this work they are computed using neural networks. First, all phone labels are mapped into vectors of binary distinctive features (DFs, e.g., nasal/notnasal). Then for each speech frame the corresponding DF vector is concatenated with DF vectors of previous and next frames and fed into a neural network that is trained to estimate the acoustic coefficients (e.g., MFCCs) of that frame. The values of the first hidden layer represent the embedding of the input DF vectors. Finally, the resulting embeddings are used as secondary task targets in a multi-task learning (MTL) setting when training the DNN that computes phone state posteriors. The approach allows to easily encode a much larger context than alternative MTL-based approaches. Results on TIMIT with a fully connected DNN shows phone error rate (PER) reductions from 22.4% to 21.0% and from 21.3% to 19.8% on the test core and the validation set respectively and lower PER than an alternative strong MTL approach.",

By combining pump-probe spectroscopy and linear response time-dependent density functional theory within the random phase approximation (TDDFT-RPA) we elucidate the excited state dynamics of the E11 transition within (6,5) and (7,5) single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) and combined with poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) in P3HT/PCBM/SWNT blended samples. We find the presence of a photoinduced absorption (PA) peak is related mainly to the width of the photobleach (PB) peak and the charge carrier density of the SWNT system. For mixed SWNT samples, the PB peak is too broad to observe the PA peak, whereas within P3HT/PCBM/SWNT blended samples P3HT acts as a hole acceptor, narrowing the PB peak by exciton delocalization, which reveals a PA peak. Our results suggest that the PA peak originates from a widening of the band gap in the presence of excited electrons and holes. These results have important implications for the development of new organic photovoltaic heterojunctions including SWNTs.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 American Chemical Society. Since the first reports on high efficiency, solution processed solar cells based on hybrid lead halide perovskites, there has been an explosion of activities on these materials. Researchers with interests spanning the full range from conventional inorganic to emerging organic and hybrid optoelectronic technologies have been contributing to the prolific research output. This has led to solar cell power conversion efficiencies now exceeding 20% and the demonstration of proofs of concept for electroluminescent and lasing devices. Hybrid perovskites can be self-assembled by a simple chemical deposition of the constituent units, with the possibility of integrating the useful properties of organic and inorganic compounds at the molecular scale within a single crystalline material, thus enabling a fine-tuning of the electronic properties. Tellingly, the fundamental properties of these materials may make us think of a new, solution processable, GaAs-like semiconductor. While this can be true to a first approximation, hybrid perovskites are intrinsically complex materials, where the presence of various types of interactions and structural disorder may strongly affect their properties. In particular, a clear understanding and control of the relative interactions between the organic and inorganic moieties is of paramount importance to properly disentangle their innate physics.In this Account we review our recent studies which aim to clarify the relationship between structural and electronic properties from a molecular to mesoscopic level. First we identify the markers for local disorder at the molecular level by using Raman spectroscopy as a probe. Then, we exploit such a tool to explore the role of microstructure on the absorption and luminescence properties of the semiconductor. Finally we address the controversy surrounding electron-hole interactions and excitonic effects. We show that in hybrid lead-halide perovskites dielectric screening also depends on the local microstructure of the hybrid crystals and not only on its chemical composition. This leads to the possibility of band gap engineering and the consequent control of the elementary photoexcitation dynamics that determine the perovskites' performances in different optoelectronic devices.

All rights reserved.A simple approach to develop a novel photosensitive radio-frequency (RF) tag to be used as non-volatile wireless light exposure detector is presented. This chipless tag is based on the coupling of a standard high frequency (HF) inductor-capacitor (LC) resonator with an interdigitated planar sensor featuring a micrometric inter-electrode gap optimized for a thin acrylamide photosensitive polymer layer. Exposure to ambient light within the absorbance band of the photosensitizer (∼530 nm) triggers polymerization, which irreversibly modifies the electrical properties of the film, producing a significant decrease of the dielectric constant of 27%, thereby changing the resonance frequency (540 kHz shift) of the resonator. This allows the straightforward wireless detection of the light exposure event as demonstrated here. The sensor fabrication is fully compatible with high-throughput printing processes, therefore fostering a dramatic reduction of tag production costs and enabling mass application of disposable tags that can, for instance, be embedded into the packaging of light-sensitive goods.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 The Authors. Age-related sarcopenia is characterized by a progressive loss of muscle mass with decline in specific force, having dramatic consequences on mobility and quality of life in seniors. The etiology of sarcopenia is multifactorial and underlying mechanisms are currently not fully elucidated. Physical exercise is known to have beneficial effects on muscle trophism and force production. Alterations of mitochondrial Ca2+ homeostasis regulated by mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) have been recently shown to affect muscle trophism in vivo in mice. To understand the relevance of MCU-dependent mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake in aging and to investigate the effect of physical exercise on MCU expression and mitochondria dynamics, we analyzed skeletal muscle biopsies from 70-year-old subjects 9 weeks trained with either neuromuscular electrical stimulation (ES) or leg press. Here, we demonstrate that improved muscle function and structure induced by both trainings are linked to increased protein levels of MCU. Ultrastructural analyses by electron microscopy showed remodeling of mitochondrial apparatus in ES-trained muscles that is consistent with an adaptation to physical exercise, a response likely mediated by an increased expression of mitochondrial fusion protein OPA1. Altogether these results indicate that the ES-dependent physiological effects on skeletal muscle size and force are associated with changes in mitochondrialrelated proteins involved in Ca2+ homeostasis and mitochondrial shape. These original findings in aging human skeletal muscle confirm the data obtained in mice and propose MCU and mitochondria-related proteins as potential pharmacological targets to counteract age-related muscle loss.",

Using multiband k·p calculations, we show that strain-engineered piezoelectricity is a powerful tool to modulate the electron-hole spatial separation in a wide class of wurtzite CdSe/CdS nanocrystals. The inherent anisotropy of the hexagonal crystal structure leads to anisotropic strain and, consequently, to a pronounced piezoelectric field along the c axis, which can be amplified or quenched through a proper design of the core-shell structure. The use of large cores and thick shells promotes a gradual departure from quantum confined nanocrystals to a regime dominated by piezoelectric confinement. This allows excitons to evolve from the usual type-I and quasi-type-II behavior to a type-II behavior in dot-in-dots, dot-in-rods, rod-in-rods, and dot-in-plates. Piezoelectric fields explain experimental observations for giant-shell nanocrystals, whose time-resolved photoluminescence reveals long exciton lifetimes for large cores, contrary to the expectations of standard quantum confinement models. They also explain the large differences in exciton lifetimes reported for different classes of CdSe/CdS nanocrystals.",

However, the role of Pin1 in Myc-induced lymphomagenesis remains unknown. We show here that genetic ablation of Pin1 reduces lymphomagenesis in Eμ-myc transgenic mice. In both Pin1-deficient B-cells and MEFs, the proliferative response to oncogenic Myc was selectively impaired, with no alterations in Myc-induced apoptosis or mitogen-induced cell cycle entry. This proliferative defect wasn't attributable to alterations in either Ser 62 phosphorylation or Myc-regulated transcription, but instead relied on the activity of the ARF-p53 pathway. Pin1 silencing in lymphomas retarded disease progression in mice, making Pin1 an attractive therapeutic target in Myc-driven tumors.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 the authors. Phosphorylation of serine/threonine residues preceding a proline regulates the fate of its targets through postphosphorylation conformational changes catalyzed by the peptidyl-prolyl cis-/trans isomerase Pin1. By flipping the substrate between two different functional conformations, this enzyme exerts a fine-tuning of phosphorylation signals. Pin1 has been detected in dendritic spines and shafts where it regulates protein synthesis required to sustain the late phase of long-term potentiation (LTP). Here, we demonstrate that Pin1 residing in postsynaptic structures can interact with postsynaptic density protein-95 (PSD-95), a key scaffold protein that anchors NMDA receptors (NMDARs) in PSD via GluN2-type receptor subunits. Pin1 recruitment by PSD-95 occurs at specific serine-threonine/proline consensus motifs localized in the linker region connecting PDZ2 to PDZ3 domains. Upon binding, Pin1 triggers structural changes in PSD-95, thus negatively affecting its ability to interact with NMDARs. In electrophysiological experiments, larger NMDA-mediated synaptic currents, evoked in CA1 principal cells by Schaffer collateral stimulation, were detected in hippocampal slices obtained from Pin1−/− mice compared with controls. Similar results were obtained in cultured hippocampal cells expressing a PSD-95 mutant unable to undergo prolyl-isomerization, thus indicating that the action of Pin1 on PSD-95 is critical for this effect. In addition, an enhancement in spine density and size was detected in CA1 principal cells of Pin1−/− or in Thy-1GFP mice treated with the pharmacological inhibitor of Pin1 catalytic activity PiB. Our data indicate that Pin1 controls synaptic content of NMDARs via PSD-95 prolyl-isomerization and the expression of dendritic spines, both required for LTP maintenance.",

Recent progresses in nanotechnology fabrication gives the opportunity to build highly functional nano-devices. 3D structures based on noble metals or covered by them can be realized down to the nano-scales, obtaining different devices with the functionalities of plasmonic nano-lenses or nano-probes. Here, nano-cones decorated with silver nano-grains were fabricated using advanced nano-fabrication techniques. In fabricating the cones, the angle of the apex was varied over a significant range and, in doing so, different geometries were realized. In depositing the silver nano-particles, the concentration of solution was varied, whereby different growth conditions were realized. The combined effect of tip geometry and growth conditions influences the size and distribution of the silver nano grains. The tips have the ability to guide or control the growth of the grains, in the sense that the nano-particles would preferentially distribute along the cone, and especially at the apex of the cone, with no o minor concentration effects on the substrate. The arrangement of metallic nano-particles into three-dimensional (3D) structures results in a Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) device with improved interface with analytes compared to bi-dimensional arrays of metallic nanoparticles. In the future, similar devices may find application in microfluidic devices, and in general in flow chambers, where the system can be inserted as to mimic a a nano-bait, for the recognition of specific biomarkers, or the manipulation and chemical investigation of single cells directly in native environments with good sensitivity, repeatability and selectivity.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 American Chemical Society. Plasmonic color-graded systems are devices featuring a spatially variable plasmonic response over their surface. They are widely used as nanoscale color filters; their typical size is small enough to allow integration with miniaturized electronic circuits, paving the way to realize novel nanophotonic devices. Currently, most plasmonic color-graded systems are intrinsically discrete because their chromatic response exploits the tailored plasmon resonance of microarchitectures characterized by different size or geometry for each target color. Here, we report the realization of multifunctional plasmon-graded devices where continuously graded chromatic response is achieved by smoothly tuning the composition of the resonator material while simultaneously maintaining an achromatic nanoscale geometry. The result is a new class of versatile materials: we show their application as plasmonic filters with a potential pixel size smaller than half of the exciting wavelength but also as multiplexed surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) substrates. Many more implementations, such as photovoltaic efficiency boosters or color routers, await and will benefit from the low fabrication cost and intrinsic plasmonic flexibility of the presented systems.

The femtoliter volume confined in the holes allows to perform analysis of non-transparent aqueous solutions reducing fluorescence emission and avoiding signal absorption by surrounding liquid, which was demonstrated in the case of opaque and dye solutions. The micro-pattern based substrate was obtained by optical lithography and reactive ion etching and was selectively covered with silver nanoislands arranged in a highly homogeneous and isotropic way. Dopamine molecules and cell culture medium were used as probe analytes for SERS experiments showing that plasmonic microholes, having a very uniform enhancement, are suitable both for the detection of molecules with low Raman cross section and for the detection of biomolecules of non-transparent complex solutions. Finally, this kind of analysis requires only a tiny amount of analyte which is an important advancement for the measurements of costly or precious samples.",

In this work, we show the potential of biocompatible platinum nanoparticles (Pt NPs) as antioxidant nanozymes, which combine abundant cellular internalization and efficient scavenging activity of cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), thus simultaneously integrating the functions of nanocarriers and antioxidant drugs. Careful toxicity assessment and intracellular tracking of Pt NPs proved their cytocompatibility and high cellular uptake, with compartmentalization within the endo/lysosomal vesicles. We have demonstrated that Pt NPs possess strong and broad antioxidant properties, acting as superoxide dismutase, catalase, and peroxidase enzymes, with similar or even superior performance than natural enzymes, along with higher adaptability to the changes in environmental conditions. We then exploited their potent activity as radical scavenging materials in a cellular model of an oxidative stress-related disorder, namely human Cerebral Cavernous Malformation (CCM) disease, which is associated with a significant increase in intracellular ROS levels. Noteworthily, we found that Pt nanozymes can efficiently reduce ROS levels, completely restoring the cellular physiological homeostasis.",

Accumulating evidence has revealed a critical contribution by the Polycomb axis of epigenetic repression. However, a coherent understanding of the regulatory networks affected by Polycomb during gliomagenesis is still lacking. Here we integrate transcriptomic and epigenomic analyses to define Polycomb-dependent networks that promote gliomagenesis, validating them both in two independent mouse models and in a large cohort of human samples. We find that Polycomb dysregulation in gliomagenesis affects transcriptional networks associated with invasiveness and de-differentiation. The dissection of these networks uncovers Zfp423 as a critical Polycomb-dependent transcription factor whose silencing negatively impacts survival. The anti-gliomagenic activity of Zfp423 requires interaction with the SMAD proteins within the BMP signalling pathway, pointing to a novel synergic circuit through which Polycomb inhibits BMP signalling.",

Therefore, in this chapter we will discuss the different types of composites based on hemicellulose and hemicellulose derivatives. The chapter also deals with the types of hemicellulose derivatives and their structures and properties.

The obtained polylactic acid nanoparticles showed antimicrobial activity both with and without the presence of lemongrass oil; however, the presence of EO improved the activity of the NCs. The presence of lemongrass assisted the formation of well-separated NCs and also provided enhanced antimicrobial properties, since lemongrass is known for its antimicrobial character. Fluorescence microscopy was used to optically observe the nanoparticles and NCs and revealed the attachment of lemongrass oil with the polylactic acid NCs. Dynamic light scattering was used to determine their size. UV absorption was used to determine the exact amount of lemongrass oil found in the polylactic acid-lemongrass oil NCs, which was important for understanding the minimum inhibitory concentration for the antimicrobial experiments. A series of clinically important microbial species were used in the study and the obtained NCs proved to have very good antimicrobial properties against all tested strains. Such NCs can be used for the design of ecological strategies, based on natural alternatives, which may be efficient against severe infections, including those that involve resistant pathogens and biofilms or those with difficult to reach localization.",

We demonstrate that a conventional P3HT:PCBM bulk heterojunction architecture enclosed between a solution-processed cuprous iodide hole selective layer and a Pt-decorated nanostructured TiO2 layer can efficiently photogenerate hydrogen under acidic conditions under simulated 1 Sun illumination. This architecture showed initial photocurrents as high as 8 mA cm-2 at 0 V vs. RHE, IPCE above 50%, 100% faradaic efficiency and an ideal ratiometric power-saved figure of merit equal to 1.21%.

Four configurations were studied: top electrode in Pt, with and without polymer coating (polyacrylic acid); top electrode in Cu, with and without the same polymer coating. All the tested devices showed a bipolar resistive switching behavior, with enhanced I-V non-linearity when coated with the polymer. While well-known physical mechanisms such as vacancy and ion-dominated conduction are clearly involved in resistive switching of ZnO nanowires, the coating with the polymer induces new features in the I-V characteristics, probably thanks to the modification of the surface states of ZnO nanowires. Thus, new memristive nanodevices with enhanced electrical features can be developed with such approach.",

            "abstract": "© 2016. The thyrocytes are exposed to high levels of oxidative stress which could induce DNA damages. Base excision repair (BER) is one of the principal mechanisms of defense against oxidative DNA damage, however recent evidences suggest that also nucleotide excision repair (NER) could be involved. The aim of present work was to identify novel differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) risk variants in BER and NER genes. For this purpose, the most strongly associated SNPs within NER and BER genes found in our previous GWAS on DTC were selected and replicated in an independent series of samples for a new case-control study. Although a positive signal was detected at the nominal level of 0.05 for rs7689099 (encoding for an aminoacid change proline to arginine at codon 117 within NEIL3), none of the considered SNPs (i.e. rs7990340 and rs690860 within RFC3, rs3744767 and rs1131636 within RPA1, rs16962916 and rs3136166 in ERCC4, and rs17739370 and rs7689099 in NEIL3) was associated with the risk of DTC when the correction of multiple testing was applied. In conclusion, a role of NER and BER pathways was evoked in the susceptibility to DTC. However, this seemed to be limited to few polymorphic genes and the overall effect size appeared weak.",

            "abstract": "© Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016. Additive Manufacturing (AM) technologies represent a solution for enabling astronauts to manufacture parts in situ, as needed, starting from feedstock material. The importance of these capabilities are particularly evident in manned space exploration missions, e.g. on human Mars missions, for which cargo capacity is paramount key factor in order to supply the astronauts with everything they may need during the mission, but at the same time is a severely constrained resource. Also, AM technologies enhance freedom of shape optimization for mass savings, compared to conventional manufacturing processes, thus helping in reducing overall mass at launch. The capability to make parts in space, during the mission, would allow a dramatic reduction of the mass transported to the destination site and would also help astronauts in solving any unexpected problems that may occur during a space mission: if the Apollo had been equipped with a 3d printer, the filter housing with a suitable interface could have been easily manufactured by astronauts using Additive Manufacturing technology. The Portable on-Orbit Printer 3D represents the first European additive manufacturing experiment in space. The Printer implements the Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) process for the fabrication of parts using PLA, a biocompatible thermoplastic polymer. The objective of the experiment is to validate the 3D printing technology in microgravity and to pave the way for an Italian and European development of the additive manufacturing technology on board the ISS and, more in general, in space. This paper will present the results of the demonstration activities performed with “Portable on-Orbit Printer 3D” while its permanence on board the International Space Station. It also presents the analysis performed on the on orbit “printed” part, in comparison with the same part “printed” on ground.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 IEEE.In recent years, bowden-cable transmissions have been developed and utilized widely in many robotic applications due to advantages in durability, lightweight, safety, and flexibility. Especially, over the last decade, a substantial number of soft wearable exoskeletons using bowden cables for motion transmission have been designed for human assistance, empowerment and rehabilitation. The major advantage of soft assistive devices driven by bowden-cable transmissions is to allow decentralizing the actuation stages proximally such that their mass has the least effect on the end-effector. Besides the advantage, the main drawback of the bowden cabledriven system comes from the presence of nonlinearities such as friction and backlash hysteresis that affects their control accuracy. Hence, in this paper, we introduce a mathematical model for backlash hysteresis and propose a solution based on the nonlinear adaptive control to compensate for the backlash effect. The backlash hysteresis model and control scheme are validated first on a custom-designed test bench and then applied to control a soft exoskeleton in a preliminary human trial.",

First-principles calculations were carried out to explore the possible coupling between spin-polarized electronic states and ferroelectric polarization in monolayers of transition-metal dichalcogenides MX2 (M=Mo,W;X=S,Se,Te) with distorted octahedrally coordinated 1T structures. For d2 metal ions, two competing metal clustering effects can take place, where metal ions are arranged in trimers or zigzag chains. Among these, the former structural distortion comes along with an improper ferroelectric phase which persists in the monolayer limit. Switchable Rashba-like spin-polarization features are predicted in the trimerized polytype, which can be permanently tuned by acting on its ferroelectric properties. The polar trimerized structure is found to be stable for 1T-MoS2 only, while the nonpolar polytype with zigzag metal clustering is predicted to stabilize for other transition-metal dichalcogenides with d2 metal ions.",

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) exert their pharmacological effects by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and COX-2. Though widely prescribed for pain and inflammation, these agents have limited utility in chronic diseases due to serious mechanism-based adverse events such as gastrointestinal damage. Concomitant blockade of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) enhances the therapeutic effects of the NSAIDs while attenuating their propensity to cause gastrointestinal injury. This favorable interaction is attributed to the accumulation of protective FAAH substrates, such as the endocannabinoid anandamide, and suggests that agents simultaneously targeting COX and FAAH might provide an innovative strategy to combat pain and inflammation with reduced side effects. Here, we describe the rational design and structure-active relationship (SAR) properties of the first class of potent multitarget FAAH-COX inhibitors. A focused SAR exploration around the prototype 10r (ARN2508) led to the identification of achiral (18b) as well as racemic (29a-c and 29e) analogs. Absolute configurational assignment and pharmacological evaluation of single enantiomers of 10r are also presented. (S)-(+)-10r is the first highly potent and selective chiral inhibitor of FAAH-COX with marked in vivo activity, and represents a promising lead to discover novel analgesics and anti-inflammatory drugs.",

These three-dimensional cell aggregates reproduce the nutrient and proliferation gradients found in the early stages of cancer and can be grown with a strict control of their environmental conditions. In the last years, new experimental techniques have been developed to determine the effect of mechanical stress on the growth of tumor spheroids. These studies report a reduction in cell proliferation as a function of increasingly applied stress on the surface of the spheroids. This work presents a specialization for tumor spheroid growth of a previous more general multiphase model. The equations of the model are derived in the framework of porous media theory, and constitutive relations for the mass transfer terms and the stress are formulated on the basis of experimental observations. A set of experiments is performed, investigating the growth of U-87MG spheroids both freely growing in the culture medium and subjected to an external mechanical pressure induced by a Dextran solution. The growth curves of the model are compared to the experimental data, with good agreement for both the experimental settings. A new mathematical law regulating the inhibitory effect of mechanical compression on cancer cell proliferation is presented at the end of the paper. This new law is validated against experimental data and provides better results compared to other expressions in the literature.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 American Physical Society. Inspired by pulsed laser-assisted thermal relaxation experiments, we simulated the response of a nanometer-size monolayer graphene sample to thermal impulses by means of nonequilibrium molecular dynamics. By following the time evolution of the temperature profile until equilibrium is eventually reached, we obtain a direct estimation of the thermal conductivity of the excited graphene sample. It is shown that the predicted thermal conductivity depends on which vibrational degrees of freedom are in fact excited by the thermal impulse, suggesting that its determination depends, among many other issues, on the actual phonon population generated in the sample. The situation here explored is typically found in experiments or simulations addressing a transient regime of approach to equilibrium.",

            "abstract": "Over 50 years ago, Anderson and Blount discussed symmetry-allowed polar distortions in metals, spawning the idea that a material might be simultaneously metallic and ferroelectric. While many studies have ever since considered such or similar situations, actual ferroelectricity - that is, the existence of a switchable intrinsic electric polarization - has not yet been attained in a metal, and is in fact generally deemed incompatible with the screening by mobile conduction charges. Here we refute this common wisdom and show, by means of first-principles simulations, that native metallicity and ferroelectricity coexist in the layered perovskite Bi 5 Ti 5 O 17. We show that, despite being a metal, Bi 5 Ti 5 O 17 can sustain a sizable potential drop along the polar direction, as needed to reverse its polarization by an external bias. We also reveal striking behaviours, as the self-screening mechanism at work in thin Bi 5 Ti 5 O 17 layers, emerging from the interplay between polar distortions and carriers in this compound.",

A goalkeeper who tries to guess the ball's direction; a chess player who attempts to anticipate the opponent's next move; or a man-in-love who tries to calculate what are the chances of her saying yes-in all these cases, people are simulating possible future states of the world, in order to maximize the success of their decisions or actions. Research in neuroscience is showing that our ability to predict the behavior of physical or social phenomena is largely dependent on the brain's ability to integrate current and past information to generate (probabilistic) simulations of the future. But could predictive processing be augmented using advanced technologies? In this contribution, we discuss how computational technologies may be used to support, facilitate or enhance the prediction of future events, by considering exemplificative scenarios across different domains, from simpler sensorimotor decisions to more complex cognitive tasks. We also examine the key scientific and technical challenges that must be faced to turn this vision into reality.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 The Author(s).Background: Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are emerging as polygenic and multifactorial disorders in which complex interactions between defective genes and early exposure to environmental stressors impact on the correct neurodevelopment and brain processes. Organophosphate insecticides, among which chlorpyrifos (CPF), are widely diffused environmental toxicants associated with neurobehavioral deficits and increased risk of ASD occurrence in children. Oxidative stress and dysregulated immune responses are implicated in both organophosphate neurodevelopmental effects and ASD etiopathogenesis. BTBR T+tf/J mice, a well-studied model of idiopathic autism, show several behavioral and immunological alterations found in ASD children, and we recently showed that CPF gestational exposure strengthened some of these autistic-like traits. In the present study, we aimed at investigating whether the behavioral effects of gestational CPF administration are associated with brain increased oxidative stress and altered lipid mediator profile. Methods: Brain levels of F2-isoprostanes (15-F2t-IsoP), as index of in vivo oxidative stress, and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), a major arachidonic acid metabolite released by immune cells and by specific glutamatergic neuron populations mainly in cortex and hippocampus, were assessed by specific enzyme-immuno assays in brain homogenates from BTBR T+tf/J and C57Bl6/J mice, exposed during gestation to either vehicle or CPF. Measures were performed in mice of both sexes, at different postnatal stages (PNDs 1, 21, and 70). Results: At birth, BTBR T+tf/J mice exhibited higher baseline 15-F2t-IsoP levels as compared to C57Bl6/J mice, suggestive of greater oxidative stress processes. Gestational treatment with CPF-enhanced 15-F2t-IsoP and PGE2 levels in strain- and age-dependent manner, with 15-F2t-IsoP increased in BTBR T+tf/J mice at PNDs 1 and 21, and PGE2 elevated in BTBR T+tf/J mice at PNDs 21 and 70. At PND 21, CPF effects were sex-dependent being the increase of the two metabolites mainly associated with male mice. CPF treatment also induced a reduction of somatic growth, which reached statistical significance at PND 21. Conclusions: These findings indicate that the autistic-like BTBR T+tf/J strain is highly vulnerable to environmental stressors during gestational period. The results further support the hypothesis that oxidative stress might be the link between environmental neurotoxicants such as CPF and ASD. The increased levels of oxidative stress during early postnatal life could result in delayed and long-lasting alterations in specific pathways relevant to ASD, of which PGE2 signaling represents an important one.",

Activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) is a method for the identification of an enzyme of interest in a complex proteome through the use of a chemical probe that targets the enzyme's active sites. A reporter tag introduced into the probe allows for the detection of the labeled enzyme by in-gel fluorescence scanning, protein blot, fluorescence microscopy, or liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Here, we describe the preparation and use of the compound ARN14686, a click chemistry activity-based probe (CC-ABP) that selectively recognizes the enzyme N-acylethanolamine acid amidase (NAAA). NAAA is a cysteine hydrolase that promotes inflammation by deactivating endogenous peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-alpha agonists such as palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) and oleoylethanolamide (OEA). NAAA is synthesized as an inactive full-length proenzyme, which is activated by autoproteolysis in the acidic pH of the lysosome. Localization studies have shown that NAAA is predominantly expressed in macrophages and other monocyte-derived cells, as well as in B-lymphocytes. We provide examples of how ARN14686 can be used to detect and quantify active NAAA ex vivo in rodent tissues by protein blot and fluorescence microscopy.",

Our method combines two key insights: (1) a visual 6 Degreeof-Freedom (DoF) pose estimation technique based on 2D-3D point correspondences is used to estimate the object pose in real-time and (2) the rigid transformation from the current to the nominal pose is computed online and the object is reoriented over a sequence of steps. The outcome of this work is a novel method that can be effectively used in the preparatory phase of a manipulation task, to permit a robot to start from arbitrary object placements and configure the manipulated objects to the nominal pose, as required for the execution of a subsequent task. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a full-size humanoid robot (WALK-MAN) using different objects with various pose settings under real-time constraints.",

The high-temperature phase of IrTe2 (trigonal at 295 K) reveals a clear anomaly in the Ir-Te correlations at ∼4 GPa, while the low-temperature phase (at 100 K) shows a smaller change at ∼6 GPa, likely to be associated with transitions in lower-symmetry phases. XANES spectra, measuring higher-order atomic correlations, also show nonlinear pressure dependence in the local geometry at the anomalous pressures. These nonlinear changes suggest that IrTe2 goes through lower local symmetry phases with increasing pressure.",

KGaA, Weinheim Among known molecular switches, spiropyrans attract considerable interest because of their reversible responsiveness to external stimuli and the deep conformational and electronic changes that characterize the switching process between the two isomeric forms [spiropyran (SP) and merocyanine (MC)]. Metal coordination is one of the most interesting aspects of spiropyrans for its potential in sensing, catalysis, and medicinal chemistry, but little is known about the details surrounding spiropyran–metal ion binding. We investigated the interplay between an N-modified 8-methoxy-6-nitrospiropyran (SP-E), designed to provide appropriate molecular flexibility and a range of competing/collaborative metal binding sites, with Mg2+, Cu2+ and Zn2+, which were chosen for their similar coordination geometry preferences while differing in their hard/soft character. The formed molecular complexes were studied by means of UV/Vis, fluorescence, and NMR spectroscopies and mass spectrometry, and the crystal structure of the SP-E–Cu complex was also obtained. The results indicate that the Mg2+, Zn2+ and Cu2+ complexes have identical coordination stoichiometry. Furthermore, the Mg2+ and Zn2+ complexes display fluorescence properties in solution and visible-light responsiveness. These results provide important spectroscopic and structural information that can serve as a foundation for rational design of spiropyran-based smart materials for metal sensing and scavenging applications.",

According to the ‘ceRNA hypothesis’, microRNAs (miRNAs) may act as mediators of an effective positive interaction between long coding or non-coding RNA molecules, carrying significant potential implications for a variety of biological processes. Here, inspired by recent work providing a quantitative description of small regulatory elements as information-conveying channels, we characterize the effectiveness of miRNA-mediated regulation in terms of the optimal information flow achievable between modulator (transcription factors) and target nodes (long RNAs). Our findings show that, while a sufficiently large degree of target derepression is needed to activate miRNA-mediated transmission, (a) in case of differential mechanisms of complex processing and/or transcriptional capabilities, regulation by a post-transcriptional miRNA-channel can outperform that achieved through direct transcriptional control; moreover, (b) in the presence of large populations of weakly interacting miRNA molecules the extra noise coming from titration disappears, allowing the miRNA-channel to process information as effectively as the direct channel. These observations establish the limits of miRNA-mediated post-transcriptional cross-talk and suggest that, besides providing a degree of noise buffering, this type of control may be effectively employed in cells both as a failsafe mechanism and as a preferential fine tuner of gene expression, pointing to the specific situations in which each of these functionalities is maximized.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 American Chemical Society.Polyelectrolyte layer-by-layer (LbL) films have many applications, but several parameters and procedures during film fabrication determine their morphology and molecular arrangement, with important practical consequences. Here we have used optical second-harmonic generation (SHG) to investigate the molecular ordering of LbL films containing the anionic azopolymer PS-119 and the cationic polyelectrolyte PAH. We show that spontaneous drying leads to laterally homogeneous and isotropic films, while the opposite occurs for nitrogen-flow drying. The effect of film thickness and pH of the assembling/rinsing solutions on the molecular ordering was also investigated. The optical nonlinearity tends to significantly decrease for thicker films (∼10 bilayers), and a slight alternation of SHG intensity for films with odd or even number of layers (complete vs incomplete bilayers) was also observed, which results from the reorientation of azopolymer groups in the last layer after adsorption of an additional PAH layer. We propose a qualitative electrostatic model to explain the pH dependence of film growth and azopolymer orientation, which is based on changes of the charge density of the substrate and PAH and on different ionic screening of electrostatic interactions at various pH values. We also found that the nonlinear response presents a gradual and significant reduction upon heating, which is inconsistent with a glass transition temperature for these ultrathin LbL films. The thermal stability is improved with a combination of low ionic strength and higher charge density of the polyelectrolytes and substrate, which promotes better interlayer complexation. The SHG signal is recovered upon cooling, although for some conditions the molecular arrangement became anisotropic after a heating/cooling cycle. Such detailed information about the structural order of thin nonlinear optical azopolymer LbL films demonstrates that SHG is a powerful technique to probe the film structure at the molecular level, with important consequences for their applications in optical devices.",

In this technique the pump-probe scheme is exploited to study the vibrational structure of the sample via stimulated Raman scattering. We apply closed-time-path-loop diagrams to calculate the complete response of the system at the relevant perturbation order. We show that, in presence of low-frequency modes, coherences created by the impulsive pump modify the resulting Raman signal, which oscillates from gain to loss features, depending on the time delay between the pump and probe pulses. This leads to a redistribution of photons among the fields involved in the process and, consequently, the energy flows between fields and matter. Moreover, through this formalism, we address the case of extremely short delays in which the pump and probe fields overlap in time. We find that, even in absence of photo-induced dynamics due to absorption of the pump pulse, the overlap condition can generate time dependent features, arising from additional diagrams, which offer no contribution for well separated pulses.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 The Author(s). Background: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an adult-onset neurodegenerative disorder that is typically fatal within 3-5 years of diagnosis. While motoneuron death is the defining characteristic of ALS, the events that underlie its pathology are not restricted to the nervous system. In this regard, ALS muscle atrophies and weakens significantly before presentation of neurological symptoms. Since the skeletal muscle L-type Ca2+ channel (CaV1.1) is a key regulator of both mass and force, we investigated whether CaV1.1 function is impaired in the muscle of two distinct mouse models carrying an ALS-linked mutation. Methods: We recorded L-type currents, charge movements, and myoplasmic Ca2+ transients from dissociated flexor digitorum brevis (FDB) fibers to assess CaV1.1 function in two mouse models expressing a type 1 Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase mutant (SOD1G93A). Results: In FDB fibers obtained from \"symptomatic\" global SOD1G93A mice, we observed a substantial reduction of SR Ca2+ release in response to depolarization relative to fibers harvested from age-matched control mice. L-type current and charge movement were both reduced by ~40 % in symptomatic SOD1G93A fibers when compared to control fibers. Ca2+ transients were not significantly reduced in similar experiments performed with FDB fibers obtained from \"early-symptomatic\" SOD1G93A mice, but L-type current and charge movement were decreased (~30 and ~20 %, respectively). Reductions in SR Ca2+ release (~35 %), L-type current (~20 %), and charge movement (~15 %) were also observed in fibers obtained from another model where SOD1G93A expression was restricted to skeletal muscle. Conclusions: We report reductions in EC coupling, L-type current density, and charge movement in FDB fibers obtained from symptomatic global SOD1G93A mice. Experiments performed with FDB fibers obtained from early-symptomatic SOD1G93A and skeletal muscle autonomous MLC/SOD1G93A mice support the idea that events occurring locally in the skeletal muscle contribute to the impairment of CaV1.1 function in ALS muscle independently of innervation status.",

Deregulated Notch signaling is associated with T-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (T-ALL) development and progression. Increasing evidence reveals that Notch pathway has an important role in the invasion ability of tumor cells, including leukemia, although the underlying molecular mechanisms remain mostly unclear. Here, we show that Notch3 is a novel target protein of the prolyl-isomerase Pin1, which is able to regulate Notch3 protein processing and to stabilize the cleaved product, leading to the increased expression of the intracellular domain (N3IC), finally enhancing Notch3-dependent invasiveness properties. We demonstrate that the combined inhibition of Notch3 and Pin1 in the Notch3-overexpressing human leukemic TALL-1 cells reduces their high invasive potential, by decreasing the expression of the matrix metalloprotease MMP9. Consistently, Pin1 depletion in a mouse model of Notch3-induced T-ALL, by reducing N3IC expression and signaling, impairs the expansion/invasiveness of CD4+ CD8+ DP cells in peripheral lymphoid and non-lymphoid organs. Notably, in in silico gene expression analysis of human T-ALL samples we observed a significant correlation between Pin1 and Notch3 expression levels, which may further suggest a key role of the newly identified Notch3-Pin1 axis in T-ALL aggressiveness and progression. Thus, combined suppression of Pin1 and Notch3 proteins may be exploited as an additional target therapy for T-ALL.",

Electrical conductance of an aqueous pore in the lipid bilayer has an important role in the process of membrane electroporation, i.e., formation of pores induced by electric pulses. In our present study we compare the pore conductance as predicted by a theoretical model based on the continuum Poisson–Nernst–Planck theory to the pore conductance obtained with molecular dynamics simulations (Casciola et al., Bioelectrochemistry 109:108–116, 2016). Our analysis demonstrates that the Poisson–Nernst–Planck model is able to quantitatively predict the dependence of the pore conductance on the pore radius when considering the toroidal shape of the pore. In order to correctly describe the difference in the pore conductance for Cl and Na ions (the pore selectivity), however, it is necessary to take into account the electric double layer next to the lipid–water interface and the electroosmotic flow through the pore. We further show that simplified analytical descriptions of pore conductance can lead to incorrect predictions of the pore size extracted from experimental measurements, and can affect the predictions of electroporation models. Overall, this study demonstrates that continuum modeling can be efficiently used as complementary method to molecular scale models for investigating lipid pores.",

In the last decade, numerous MD studies have been conducted to model the effect of pulsed electric fields on membranes, providing molecular models of the EP process of lipid bilayers. Here we extend these investigations by modeling for the first time conditions comparable to experiments using long (μs-ms) low intensity (~. kV/cm) pulses, by studying the characteristics of pores formed in lipid bilayers maintained at a constant surface tension and subject to constant charge imbalance. This enables the evaluation of structural (size) and electrical (conductance) properties of the pores formed, providing information hardly accessible directly by experiments. Extensive simulations of EP of simple phosphatidylcholine bilayers in 1 M NaCl show that hydrophilic pores with stable radii (1-2.5 nm) form under transmembrane voltages between 420 and 630 mV, allowing for ionic conductance in the range of 6.4-29.5 nS. We discuss in particular these findings and characterize both convergence and size effects in the MD simulations. We further extend these studies in a follow-up paper (Rems et al., Bioelectrochemistry, Submitted), by proposing an improved continuum model of pore conductance consistent with the results from the MD simulations.",

When it was noticed that 5D-8.1 may cross-react with human proteins, doubt was casted on the significance of the above histopathologic findings. To address this issue, properties of EV antibodies 5D-8.1 and 9D5 have been investigated using peptide microarrays, peptide substitution scanning, immunofluorescence of EV-infected cells, EV neutralization assays, bioinformatics analysis. Evidence indicates that the two antibodies bind to distinct non-neutralizing linear epitopes in VP1 and are specific for a vast spectrum of EV types (not for other human viruses). However, their epitopes may align with a few human proteins at low expected values. When tested by immunofluorescence, high concentrations of 5D-8.1 yelded faint cytoplasmic staining in uninfected cells. At reduced concentrations, both antibodies produced dotted staining only in the cytoplasm of infected cells and recognized both acute and persistent EV infection.

            "abstract": "© 2016 The Author(s). Background: The importance to restore the hand function following an injury/disease of the nervous system led to the development of novel rehabilitation interventions. Surface electromyography can be used to create a user-driven control of a rehabilitation robot, in which the subject needs to engage actively, by using spared voluntary activation to trigger the assistance of the robot. Methods: The study investigated methods for the selective estimation of individual finger movements from high-density surface electromyographic signals (HD-sEMG) with minimal interference between movements of other fingers. Regression was evaluated in online and offline control tests with nine healthy subjects (per test) using a linear discriminant analysis classifier (LDA), a common spatial patterns proportional estimator (CSP-PE), and a thresholding (THR) algorithm. In all tests, the subjects performed an isometric force tracking task guided by a moving visual marker indicating the contraction type (flexion/extension), desired activation level and the finger that should be moved. The outcome measures were mean square error (nMSE) between the reference and generated trajectories normalized to the peak-to-peak value of the reference, the classification accuracy (CA), the mean amplitude of the false activations (MAFA) and, in the offline tests only, the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCORR). Results: The offline tests demonstrated that, for the reduced number of electrodes (≤24), the CSP-PE outperformed the LDA with higher precision of proportional estimation and less crosstalk between the movement classes (e.g., 8 electrodes, median MAFA ~ 0.6 vs. 1.1 %, median nMSE ~ 4.3 vs. 5.5 %). The LDA and the CSP-PE performed similarly in the online tests (median nMSE &lt; 3.6 %, median MAFA &lt; 0.7 %), but the CSP-PE provided a more stable performance across the tested conditions (less improvement between different sessions). Furthermore, THR, exploiting topographical information about the single finger activity from HD-sEMG, provided in many cases a regression accuracy similar to that of the pattern recognition techniques, but the performance was not consistent across subjects and fingers. Conclusions: The CSP-PE is a method of choice for selective individual finger control with the limited number of electrodes (&lt;24), whereas for the higher resolution of the recording, either method (CPS-PA or LDA) can be used with a similar performance. Despite the abundance of detection points, the simple THR showed to be significantly worse compared to both pattern recognition/regression methods. Nevertheless, THR is a simple method to apply (no training), and it could still give satisfactory performance in some subjects and/or simpler scenarios (e.g., control of selected fingers). These conclusions are important for guiding future developments towards the clinical application of the methods for individual finger control in rehabilitation robotics.",

In cancer, the tumour suppressor gene TP53 undergoes frequent missense mutations that endow mutant p53 proteins with oncogenic properties. Until now, a universal mutant p53 gain-of-function program has not been defined. By means of multi-omics: proteome, DNA interactome (chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing) and transcriptome (RNA sequencing/microarray) analyses, we identified the proteasome machinery as a common target of p53 missense mutants. The mutant p53-proteasome axis globally affects protein homeostasis, inhibiting multiple tumour-suppressive pathways, including the anti-oncogenic KSRP-microRNA pathway. In cancer cells, p53 missense mutants cooperate with Nrf2 (NFE2L2) to activate proteasome gene transcription, resulting in resistance to the proteasome inhibitor carfilzomib. Combining the mutant p53-inactivating agent APR-246 (PRIMA-1MET) with the proteasome inhibitor carfilzomib is effective in overcoming chemoresistance in triple-negative breast cancer cells, creating a therapeutic opportunity for treatment of solid tumours and metastasis with mutant p53.",

Photo-Thermal Induced Resonance (PTIR) nanospectroscopy, tuned towards amide-I absorption, was used to study the distribution of proteic material in 34 different HeLa cells, of which 18 were chemically stressed by oxidative stress with Na3AsO3. The cell nucleus was found to provide a weaker amide-I signal than the surrounding cytoplasm, while the strongest PTIR signal comes from the perinuclear region. AFM topography shows that the cells exposed to oxidative stress undergo a volume reduction with respect to the control cells, through an accumulation of the proteic material around and above the nucleus. This is confirmed by the PTIR maps of the cytoplasm, where the pixels providing a high amide-I signal were identified with a space resolution of ∼300 × 300 nm. By analyzing their distribution with two different statistical procedures we found that the probability to find protein clusters smaller than 0.6 μm in the cytoplasm of stressed HeLa cells is higher by 35% than in the control cells. These results indicate that it is possible to study proteic clustering within single cells by label-free optical nanospectroscopy.",

The EphA2 receptor tyrosine kinase plays key roles in tissue homeostasis and disease processes such as cancer, pathological angiogenesis, and inflammation through two distinct signaling mechanisms. EphA2 \"canonical\" signaling involves ephrin-A ligand binding, tyrosine autophosphorylation, and kinase activity; EphA2 \"noncanonical\" signaling involves phosphorylation of serine 897 (S897) by AKT and RSK kinases. To identify small molecules counteracting EphA2 canonical signaling, we developed a high-content screening platform measuring inhibition of ephrin-A1-induced PC3 prostate cancer cell retraction. Surprisingly, most hits from a screened collection of pharmacologically active compounds are agents that elevate intracellular cAMP by activating G protein-coupled receptors such as the β2-Adrenoceptor. We found that cAMP promotes phosphorylation of S897 by protein kinase A (PKA) as well as increases the phosphorylation of several nearby serine/threonine residues, which constitute a phosphorylation hotspot. Whereas EphA2 canonical and noncanonical signaling have been viewed as mutually exclusive, we show that S897 phosphorylation by PKA can coexist with EphA2 tyrosine phosphorylation and block cell retraction induced by EphA2 kinase activity. Our findings reveal a novel paradigm in EphA2 function involving the interplay of canonical and noncanonical signaling and highlight the ability of the β2-Adrenoceptor/cAMP/PKA axis to rewire EphA2 signaling in a subset of cancer cells.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 Elsevier Ltd In the past few years, proline-rich transmembrane protein (PRRT)2 has been identified as the causative gene for several paroxysmal neurological disorders. Recently, an important role of PRRT2 in synapse development and function has emerged. Knock down of the protein strongly impairs the formation of synaptic contacts and neurotransmitter release. At the nerve terminal, PRRT2 endows synaptic vesicle exocytosis with Ca2+ sensitivity by interacting with proteins of the fusion complex and with the Ca2+ sensors synaptotagmins (Syts). In the postsynaptic compartment, PRRT2 interacts with glutamate receptors. The study of PRRT2 and of its mutations may help in refining our knowledge of the process of synaptic transmission and elucidating the pathogenetic mechanisms leading to derangement of network function in paroxysmal disorders.",

Heterozygous mutations in proline-rich transmembrane protein 2 (PRRT2) underlie a group of paroxysmal disorders, including epilepsy, kinesigenic dyskinesia, and migraine. Most of the mutations lead to impaired PRRT2 expression, suggesting that loss of PRRT2 function may contribute to pathogenesis. We show that PRRT2 is enriched in presynaptic terminals and that its silencing decreases the number of synapses and increases the number of docked synaptic vesicles at rest. PRRT2-silenced neurons exhibit a severe impairment of synchronous release, attributable to a sharp decrease in release probability and Ca2+ sensitivity and associated with a marked increase of the asynchronous/synchronous release ratio. PRRT2 interacts with the synaptic proteins SNAP-25 and synaptotagmin 1/2. The results indicate that PRRT2 is intimately connected with the Ca2+-sensing machinery and that it plays an important role in the final steps of neurotransmitter release.",

Size-dependent exciton ground and excited state energies and population dynamics are determined by four independent methods: time-resolved PL, time-integrated PL, rate equation modeling, and Hartree renormalized k·p calculations - all in very good agreement. The ground state-excited state energy spacing strongly increases with the lateral platelet quantization. Depending on its detuning to the LO phonon energy, the PL decay of CdSe platelets is governed by a size tunable LO phonon bottleneck, related to the low exciton-phonon coupling, very large oscillator strength, and energy spacing of both states. This is, for instance, ideal to tune lasing properties. CdSe platelets are perfectly suited to control the exciton-phonon interaction by changing their lateral size while the optical transition energy is determined by their thickness.",

Acid ceramidase (AC) is a lysosomal cysteine amidase responsible for the cleavage of ceramide into sphingosine, which is then phosphorylated to sphingosine 1-phosphate. AC regulates the intracellular levels of ceramide and sphingosine, and AC inhibition may be useful in the treatment of disorders, such as cancer, in which ceramide-mediated signaling may be dysfunctional. Despite their potential experimental and therapeutic value, the number of available small-molecule inhibitors of AC activity remains limited. In the present study is described the discovery of a class of potent pyrazole carboxamide-based AC inhibitors, which were identified using the atomic property field (APF) approach and developed through systematic SAR investigations and in vitro pharmacological characterization. The best compound of this series inhibits AC with nanomolar potency and causes ceramide accumulation and sphingosine depletion in intact G361 proliferative melanoma cells. By expanding the current armamentarium of AC inhibitors, these results should facilitate future efforts to unravel the biology of AC and the therapeutic potential of its inhibition.",

Here we present pyrolytic carbon-coated stainless steel felt (C-SS felt) as a high-performance and scalable anode. The electrode is created by generating a carbon layer on stainless steel felt (SS felt) via a multi-step deposition process involving α-d-glucose impregnation, caramelization, and pyrolysis. Physicochemical characterizations of the surface elucidate that a thin (20 ± 5 μm) and homogenous layer of polycrystalline graphitic carbon was obtained on SS felt surface after modification. The carbon coating significantly increases the biocompatibility, enabling robust electroactive biofilm formation. The C-SS felt electrodes reach current densities (jmax) of 3.65 ± 0.14 mA/cm2 within 7 days of operation, which is 11 times higher than plain SS felt electrodes (0.30 ± 0.04 mA/cm2). The excellent biocompatibility, high specific surface area, high conductivity, good mechanical strength, and low cost make C-SS felt a promising electrode for BESs.",

We propose two analytical expressions aiming to rationalize the spin-component-scaled (SCS) and spin-opposite-scaled (SOS) schemes for double-hybrid exchange-correlation density-functionals.

The SOS variant is revealed as a less computationally demanding alternative to reach the accuracy of the original QIDH model without losing any theoretical background.",

These measures express the ratio of a change in the state of motion of the robot's center of mass to the amount of action required at the actuated joints in order to produce that change. They therefore represent measures of the gain of the robot mechanism as seen from the point of view of the balance control system. This paper is concerned mainly with ratios of velocities, called velocity gains, and it builds on earlier work by showing how these ratios can be defined and calculated for the case of a general planar or spatial robot balancing on a point, line or general rolling contact, or an area contact with a compliant surface. The paper concludes with three examples of use - design of a triple pendulum, analysis of a hydraulic quadruped, and expressing the physics of planar balancing - followed by a short discussion of gyroscopic balancing.",

            "abstract": "Â© 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Reversible photoswitching has been proposed as a way to identify molecules that are present in small numbers over a large, non-switching, background. This approach, called optical-lock-in-detection (OLID) requires the deterministic control of the fluorescence of a photochromic emitter through optical modulation between a bright (on) and a dark state (off). OLID yields a high-contrast map where the switching molecules are pinpointed, but the fractional intensities of the emitters are not returned. The present work presents a modified OLID approach (quantitative OLID or qOLID) that yields quantitative information of the switching (fSW) and non-switching (fNS) components. After the validation of the method with a sample dataset and image sequence, we apply qOLID to measurements in cells that transiently express the photochromic protein EYQ1. We show that qOLID is efficient in separating the modulated from the non-modulated signal, the latter deriving from background/autofluorescence or fluorophores emitting in the same spectral region. Finally, we apply qOLID to FÃ¶rster (Fluorescence) Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) imaging. We here demonstrate that qOLID is able to highlight the distribution of FRET intensity in a sample by using a photochromic donor and a non-photochromic acceptor.",

Recent work has shown that electron spins in germanium (Ge) nanoscale transistors can be electrically tuned and have encouraging coherence times. Based on a complete and validated theory of Ge-donor electron states, we propose that Ge spin qubits could have significant advantages over silicon (Si) in the implementation of a donor-based quantum processor architecture. Our work shows that the intrinsic features of the Ge band structure allow for a speedup of selective (local) one-qubit gates of up to two orders of magnitude as compared to Si. Further, we find that fast, robust two-qubit gates in Ge pose less stringent fabrication constraints than in Si devices: Ge donors spaced three times farther apart than in Si show comparable exchange couplings, allowing more space for readout and control gates. In addition, for realistic position uncertainty in donor placement, Ge:P spin couplings have a 33% chance of being within an order of magnitude of the largest coupling, compared with only 10% in Si:P. It is therefore possible that a Ge-based platform would enable fast, parallel, and robust architectures for quantum computing.",

An accurate modeling of the optical interactions in these systems requires an accurate description of both quantum effects and far-field properties. Classical electromagnetism can only describe the latter, while time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) can provide a full first-principles quantum treatment. However, TD-DFT becomes computationally prohibitive for sizes that exceed few nanometers, which are instead very important for most applications. In this article, we introduce a method based on the quantum hydrodynamic theory (QHT) that includes nonlocal contributions of the kinetic energy and the correct asymptotic description of the electron density. We show that our QHT method can predict both plasmon energy and spill-out effects in metal nanoparticles in excellent agreement with TD-DFT predictions, thus allowing reliable and efficient calculations of both quantum and far-field properties in multiscale plasmonic systems.",

These become gapped upon the introduction of spin-orbit coupling, giving rise to an insulating ground state comprising four edge states. We discuss the origin of the lack of topological protection in terms of the valley spin-Chern numbers and the multiplicity of Dirac points.

Most issues are related to the simultaneous action of high temperatures, corrosive environments and radiation damage. Oxide nanoceramics are a promising class of materials which may benefit from the radiation tolerance of nanomaterials and the chemical compatibility of ceramics with many highly corrosive environments. Here, using thin films as a model system, we provide new insights into the radiation tolerance of oxide nanoceramics exposed to increasing damage levels at 600 °C-namely 20, 40 and 150 displacements per atom. Specifically, we investigate the evolution of the structural features, the mechanical properties, and the response to impact loading of Al2O3 thin films. Initially, the thin films contain a homogeneous dispersion of nanocrystals in an amorphous matrix. Irradiation induces crystallization of the amorphous phase, followed by grain growth. Crystallization brings along an enhancement of hardness, while grain growth induces softening according to the Hall-Petch effect. During grain growth, the excess mechanical energy is dissipated by twinning. The main energy dissipation mechanisms available upon impact loading are lattice plasticity and localized amorphization. These mechanisms are available in the irradiated material, but not in the as-deposited films.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 Portelli et al.How a population of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) encodes the visual scene remains an open question. Going beyond individual RGC coding strategies, results in salamander suggest that the relative latencies of a RGC pair encode spatial information. Thus, a population code based on this concerted spiking could be a powerful mechanism to transmit visual information rapidly and efficiently. Here, we tested this hypothesis in mouse by recording simultaneous light-evoked responses from hundreds of RGCs, at pan-retinal level, using a new generation of largescale, high-density multielectrode array consisting of 4096 electrodes. Interestingly, we did not find any RGCs exhibiting a clear latency tuning to the stimuli, suggesting that in mouse, individual RGC pairs may not provide sufficient information. We show that a significant amount of information is encoded synergistically in the concerted spiking of large RGC populations. Thus, the RGC population response described with relative activities, or ranks, provides more relevant information than classical independent spike count- or latency-based codes. In particular, we report for the first time that when considering the relative activities across the whole population, the wave of first stimulus-evoked spikes is an accurate indicator of stimulus content. We show that this coding strategy coexists with classical neural codes, and that it is more efficient and faster. Overall, these novel observations suggest that already at the level of the retina, concerted spiking provides a reliable and fast strategy to rapidly transmit new visual scenes.",

            "abstract": "© 2015 The Authors. Recently, hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) has been shown to act as an ideal substrate to graphene by greatly improving the material transport properties thanks to its atomically flat surface, low interlayer electronic coupling and almost perfect reticular matching [1]. Chemical vapour deposition (CVD) is presently considered the most scalable approach to grow graphene directly on h-BN. However, for the catalyst-free approach, poor control over the shape and crystallinity of the graphene grains and low growth rates are typically reported [2-5]. In this work we investigate the crystallinity of differently shaped grains and identify a path towards a real van der Waals epitaxy of graphene on h-BN by adopting a catalyst-free CVD process. We demonstrate the polycrystalline nature of circular-shaped pads and attribute the stemming of different oriented grains to airborne contamination of the h-BN flakes. We show that single-crystal grains with six-fold symmetry can be obtained by adopting high hydrogen partial pressures during growth. Notably, growth rates as high as 100 nm/min are obtained by optimizing growth temperature and pressure. The possibility of synthesizing single-crystal graphene on h-BN with appreciable growth rates by adopting a simple CVD approach is a step towards an increased accessibility of this promising van der Waals heterostructure.",

All rights reserved.Rasd2 is a thyroid hormone target gene, which encodes for a GTP-binding protein enriched in the striatum where, among other functions, it modulates dopaminergic neurotransmission. Here we report that human RASD2 mRNA is abundant in putamen, but it also occurs in the cerebral cortex, with a distinctive expression pattern that differs from that present in rodents. Consistent with its localization, we found that a genetic variation in RASD2 (rs6518956) affects postmortem prefrontal mRNA expression in healthy humans and is associated with phenotypes of relevance to schizophrenia, including prefrontal and striatal grey matter volume and physiology during working memory, as measured with magnetic resonance imaging. Interestingly, quantitative real-time PCR analysis indicated that RASD2 mRNA is slightly reduced in postmortem prefrontal cortex of patients with schizophrenia. In the attempt to uncover the neurobiological substrates associated with Rasd2 activity, we used knockout mice to analyze the in vivo influence of this G-protein on the prepulse inhibition of the startle response and psychotomimetic drug-related behavioral response. Data showed that Rasd2 mutants display deficits in basal prepulse inhibition that, in turn, exacerbate gating disruption under psychotomimetic drug challenge. Furthermore, we documented that lack of Rasd2 strikingly enhances the behavioral sensitivity to motor stimulation elicited by amphetamine and phencyclidine. Based on animal model data, along with the finding that RASD2 influences prefronto-striatal phenotypes in healthy humans, we suggest that genetic mutation or reduced levels of this G-protein might have a role in cerebral circuitry dysfunction underpinning exaggerated psychotomimetic drugs responses and development of specific biological phenotypes linked to schizophrenia.",

In both phases, we carefully investigated Rashba and Dresselhaus effects, giving rise to spin-splitting in their bulk electronic structure, particularly near the conduction band minimum, supplementing our first-principles results with an effective k·p model analysis. The full reversal of the spin texture with ferroelectric polarization switching was also predicted.

After updating the application of recently introduced approaches for evaluating the likely bacterial relatives to the symbionts that originated the mitochondrial organelles, the article examines the possibility that such symbionts might have engaged in a syntrophic association with ammonia-oxidizing archaea. The bacterial ancestors of mitochondria could have provided the ammonia required for chemoautotrophic growth of the archaean host, the nitrite by-product of which could have been subsequently recycled back to ammonia by the pathway of nitrate assimilation that is shared by a few proteobacteria and several eukaryotes. The similarity of this syntrophic association with the symbiosis between nitrogen-fixing bacteria and plants is discussed in detail. The article then explores the possible presence of relics of archaean lipids in current eukaryotes, a fundamental problem that weakens current views on the evolution of the eukaryotic cell.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 American Chemical Society. Optimum amplification in surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) from individual nanoantennas is expected when the excitation is slightly blue-shifted with respect to the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), so that the LSPR peak falls in the middle between the laser and the Stokes Raman emission. Recent experiments have shown when moving the excitation from the visible to the near-infrared that this rule of thumb is no more valid. The excitation has to be red-shifted with respect to the LSPR peak, up to 80 nm, to obtain highest SERS. Such discrepancy is usually attributed to a near-field (NF) to far-field (FF) spectral shift. Here we critically discuss this hypothesis for the case of gold nanocylinders. By combining multiwavelength-excitation SERS experiments with numerical calculations, we show that the red-shift of the excitation energy does not originate from a spectral shift between the extinction (FF) and the near-field distribution (NF), which is found to be not larger than 10 nm. Rather, it can be accounted for by looking at the peculiar spectral dependence of the near-field intensity on the cylinders diameter, characterized by an initial increase, up to 180 nm diameter, followed by a decrease and a pronounced skewness.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 Elsevier Ltd. Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are evolving with an impressive pace, emerging as the most promising next-generation photovoltaic devices. Nevertheless, beside these enormous progresses, the stability of PSCs remains one of the major problems to be challenged, because the most commonly used hole transporting material (HTM), the 2,2',7,7'-Tetrakis-(N,N-di-4-methoxyphenylamino)-9,9'-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD), suffers long-term stability. Here, we tackle this long-lasting issue exploiting reduced graphene oxide (RGO), prepared by an easy and efficient reduction method, as HTM in PSCs. We carried out endurance tests over 1987 h of shelf life and 120 h of light soaking. The PSCs based on RGO have shown power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.6%, outperforming the ones achieved with the Spiro-OMeTAD (PCE=6.5%), after the shelf life test. The light soaking test confirmed the better durability of RGO-based PSCs with respect to the Spiro-OMeTAD ones, the latter showing a reduction in PCE 2.7 times higher than the RGO-based cells. Moreover, we demonstrate by Open Circuit Voltage Decay measurements that RGO, beside the HTM function, acts also as an anti-recombination layer, reducing the charge carriers recombination pathways and, hence, increasing their lifetime.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 . Atypical febrile seizures are considered a risk factor for epilepsy onset and cognitive impairments later in life. Patients with temporal lobe epilepsy and a history of atypical febrile seizures often carry a cortical malformation. This association has led to the hypothesis that the presence of a cortical dysplasia exacerbates febrile seizures in infancy, in turn increasing the risk for neurological sequelae. The mechanisms linking these events are currently poorly understood. Potassium-chloride cotransporter KCC2 affects several aspects of neuronal circuit development and function, by modulating GABAergic transmission and excitatory synapse formation. Recent data suggest that KCC2 downregulation contributes to seizure generation in the epileptic adult brain, but its role in the developing brain is still controversial.In a rodent model of atypical febrile seizures, combining a cortical dysplasia and hyperthermia-induced seizures (LHS rats), we found a premature and sustained increase in KCC2 protein levels, accompanied by a negative shift of the reversal potential of GABA. In parallel, we observed a significant reduction in dendritic spine size and mEPSC amplitude in CA1 pyramidal neurons, accompanied by spatial memory deficits. To investigate whether KCC2 premature overexpression plays a role in seizure susceptibility and synaptic alterations, we reduced KCC2 expression selectively in hippocampal pyramidal neurons by in utero electroporation of shRNA. Remarkably, KCC2 shRNA-electroporated LHS rats show reduced hyperthermia-induced seizure susceptibility, while dendritic spine size deficits were rescued. Our findings demonstrate that KCC2 overexpression in a compromised developing brain increases febrile seizure susceptibility and contribute to dendritic spine alterations.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 IEEE. In this work, to guarantee the Pisa/IIT SoftHand's grasp robustness against slippage, three reflex control modes, namely Current, Pose and Impedance, are implemented and experimentally evaluated. Towards this objective, ThimbleSense fingertip sensors are designed and integrated into the thumb and middle fingers of the SoftHand for real-time detection and control of the slippage. Current reflex regulates the restoring grasp forces of the hand by modulating the motor's current profile according to an update law. Pose and Impedance reflex modes instead replicate this behaviour by implementing an impedance control scheme. The difference between the two latter is that the stiffness gain in Impedance reflex mode is being varied in addition to the hand pose, as a function of the slippage on the fingertips. Experimental setup also includes a seven degrees-of-freedom robotic arm to realize consistent trajectories (e.g. lifting) among three control modes for the sake of comparison. Different test objects are considered to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed reflex modes in our experimental setup. Results suggest that task-appropriate restoring forces can be achieved using Impedance reflex due to its capability in demonstrating instantaneous and rather smooth reflexive behaviour during slippage. Preliminary experiments on five healthy human subjects provide evidence on the similarity of the control concepts exploited by the humans and the one realized by the Impedance reflex, highlighting its potential in prosthetic applications.",

In such context, the main results establish a new general form of the representer theorem and the consistency of the corresponding learning schemes under general conditions on the loss function, the geometry of the feature space, and the modulus of total convexity of the regularizer. In addition, the proposed analysis gives new insight into basic tools such as reproducing Banach spaces, feature maps, and universality.

To tune REST activity, we selected two protein domains that impair REST-DNA binding or recruitment of the cofactor mSin3a. Computational modeling guided the fusion of the inhibitory domains to the light-sensitive Avena sativa light- oxygen-voltage-sensing (LOV) 2-phototrophin 1 (AsLOV2). By expressing AsLOV2 chimeras in Neuro2a cells, we achieved light-dependent modulation of REST target genes that was associated with an improved neural differentiation. In primary neurons, light-mediated REST inhibition increased Na+-channel 1.2 and brain-derived neurotrophic factor transcription and boosted Na+ currents and neuronal firing. This optogenetic approach allows the coordinated expression of a cluster of genes impinging on neuronal activity, providing a tool for studying neuronal physiology and correcting gene expression changes taking place in brain diseases.",

Exceptionally, in human colorectal cancer (CRC), Tregs are thought to exert beneficial roles in controlling pro-tumor chronic inflammation. The goal of our study was to characterize CRC-infiltrating Tregs at multiple levels, by phenotypical, molecular and functional evaluation of Tregs from the tumor site, compared to non-tumoral mucosa and peripheral blood of CRC patients. The frequency of Tregs was higher in mucosa than in blood, and further significantly increased in tumor. Ex vivo, those Tregs suppressed the proliferation of tumor-infiltrating CD8+ and CD4+ T cells. A differential compartmentalization was detected between Helioshigh and Helioslow Treg subsets (thymus-derived versus peripherally induced): while Helioslow Tregs were enriched in both sites, only Helioshigh Tregs accumulated significantly and specifically in tumors, displayed a highly demethylated TSDR region and contained high proportions of cells expressing CD39 and OX40, markers of activation and suppression. Besides the suppression of T cells, Tregs may contribute to CRC progression also through releasing IL-17, or differentiating into Tfr cells that potentially antagonize a protective Tfh response, events that were both detected in tumor-associated Tregs. Overall, our data indicate that Treg accumulation may contribute through multiple mechanisms to CRC establishment and progression.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 IEEE. Intermittent feedback control for stabilizing human upright stance is a promising strategy, alternative to the standard time-continuous stiffness control. Here we show that such an intermittent controller can be established naturally through reinforcement learning. To this end, we used a single inverted pendulum model of the upright posture and a very simple reward function that gives a certain amount of punishments when the inverted pendulum falls or changes its position in the state space. We found that the acquired feedback controller exhibits hallmarks of the intermittent feedback control strategy, namely the action of the feedback controller is switched-off intermittently when the state of the pendulum is located near the stable manifold of the unstable saddle-type upright equilibrium of the inverted pendulum with no active control: this action provides an opportunity to exploit transiently converging dynamics toward the unstable upright position with no help of the active feedback control. We then speculate about a possible physiological mechanism of such reinforcement learning, and suggest that it may be related to the neural activity in the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPN) of the brainstem. This hypothesis is supported by recent evidence indicating that PPN might play critical roles for generation and regulation of postural tonus, reward prediction, as well as postural instability in patients with Parkinson's disease.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 American Chemical Society. LiMnPO4 is an attractive cathode material for the next-generation high power Li-ion batteries, due to its high theoretical specific capacity (170 mA h g-1) and working voltage (4.1 V vs Li+/Li). However, two main drawbacks prevent the practical use of LiMnPO4: its low electronic conductivity and the limited lithium diffusion rate, which are responsible for the poor rate capability of the cathode. The electronic resistance is usually lowered by coating the particles with carbon, while the use of nanosize particles can alleviate the issues associated with poor ionic conductivity. It is therefore of primary importance to develop a synthetic route to LiMnPO4 nanocrystals (NCs) with controlled size and coated with a highly conductive carbon layer. We report here an effective surface etching process (using LiPF6) on colloidally synthesized LiMnPO4 NCs that makes the NCs dispersible in the aqueous glucose solution used as carbon source for the carbon coating step. Also, it is likely that the improved exposure of the NC surface to glucose facilitates the formation of a conductive carbon layer that is in intimate contact with the inorganic core, resulting in a high electronic conductivity of the electrode, as observed by us. The carbon coated etched LiMnPO4-based electrode exhibited a specific capacity of 118 mA h g-1 at 1C, with a stable cycling performance and a capacity retention of 92% after 120 cycles at different C-rates. The delivered capacities were higher than those of electrodes based on not etched carbon coated NCs, which never exceeded 30 mA h g-1. The rate capability here reported for the carbon coated etched LiMnPO4 nanocrystals represents an important result, taking into account that in the electrode formulation 80% wt is made of the active material and the adopted charge protocol is based on reasonable fast charge times.",

A large diffusivity through the polymeric network permits the displacement of Ag ions to sustain reversible electrochemical states that store information in impedance states. We present a detailed study showing how the interaction between polymeric matrix and dispersed NPs, thanks to its huge specific surface, influences the resistive switching and electrical impedance in view of an application as soft neuromorphic devices, going beyond the simple superposition of effects due to the pure matrix and the filler alone.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 Elsevier Ltd. An impressive body of literature in the past 20 years has revealed a possible role played by cortical motor areas in action perception. One question that has been of interest is whether these areas are selectively tuned to process the actions of biological agents. However, no experiments directly testing the effects of the main characteristics identifying a biological agent (physical appearance and movement kinematics) on corticospinal excitability (CS) are present in literature. To fill this gap, we delivered single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation to the primary motor cortex and we recorded motor evoked potentials from contralateral hand muscles during observation of point-light-displays stimuli representing a hand having lost its physical appearance (Experiment 1) and kinematics characteristics (Experiment 2). Results showed that physical appearance, natural kinematics, and the possibility to identify the action behind the stimulus are not necessary conditions to modulate CS excitability during stimuli observation. We propose that the involvement of the motor system can be mandatory whenever the perceived movement, executed by a human, by an animal or by an object, is recognized as reproducible in its final outcome (e.g., position in space, direction of movement, posture of a body part, to-be-produced sound, specific interaction with an object, etc.), and that the peculiar relationship existing between others' actions and the actions executed by the observer could just represent the extreme in which the motor system is able to almost perfectly reproduce the observed stimulus as it unfolds and, consequently, contribute to stimulus perception in the most efficient way.",

Hydrogen adsorption on graphene-supported metal clusters has brought much controversy due to the complex nature of the bonding between hydrogen and metal clusters. The bond types of hydrogen and graphene-supported Ti clusters are experimentally and theoretically investigated. Transmission electron microscopy shows that Ti clusters of nanometer size are formed on graphene. Thermal desorption spectroscopy captures three hydrogen desorption peaks from hydrogenated graphene-supported Ti clusters. First-principles calculations also found three types of interaction: two types of bonds with different partial ionic character and physisorption. The physical origin for this rests on the charge state of the Ti clusters: when Ti clusters are neutral, H2 is dissociated, and H forms bonds with the Ti cluster. On the contrary, H2 is adsorbed in molecular form on positively charged Ti clusters, resulting in physisorption. Thus, this work clarifies the bonding mechanisms of hydrogen on graphene-supported Ti clusters.",

            "abstract": "© 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. We describe the use of different life stages of the Mediterranean sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus for the assessment of the possible risk posed by nanoparticles (NPs) in the coastal water. A first screening for the presence of NPs in sea water may be obtained by checking their presence inside tissues of organisms taken from the wild. The ability of NPs to pass from gut to the coelomic fluid is demonstrated by accumulation in sea urchin coelomocytes; the toxicity on sperms can be measured by embryotoxicity markers after sperm exposure, whereas the transfer through the food chain can be observed by developmental anomalies in larvae fed with microalgae exposed to NPs. The most used spermiotoxicity and embryotoxicity tests are described, as well as the biochemical and histochemical analyses of cholinesterase (ChE) activities, which are used to verify toxicity parameters such as inflammation, neurotoxicity, and interference in cell-to-cell communication. Morphological markers of toxicity, in particular skeletal anomalies, are described and classified. In addition, NPs may impair viability of the immune cells of adult specimens. Molecular similarity between echinoderm and human immune cells is shown and discussed. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Environ Toxicol 31: 1552–1562, 2016.",

            "abstract": "Epigenetic regulation plays an essential role in tumor development and epigenetic modifiers are considered optimal potential druggable candidates. In order to identify new breast cancer vulnerabilities and improve therapeutic chances for patients, we performed in vivo and in vitro shRNA screens in a human breast cancer cell model (MCF10DCIS.com cell line) using epigenetic libraries. Among the genes identified in our screening, we deeply investigated the role of Chromodomain Helicase DNA binding Protein 4 (CHD4) in breast cancer tumorigenesis. CHD4 silencing significantly reduced tumor growth in vivo and proliferation in vitro of MCF10DCIS.com cells. Similarly, in vivo breast cancer growth was decreased in a spontaneous mouse model of breast carcinoma (MMTV-NeuT system) and in metastatic patient-derived xenograft models. Conversely, no reduction in proliferative ability of non-transformed mammary epithelial cells (MCF10A) was detected. Moreover, we showed that CHD4 depletion arrests proliferation by inducing a G0/G1 block of cell cycle associated with up-regulation of CDKN1A (p21). These results highlight the relevance of genetic screens in the identification of tumor frailties and the role of CHD4 as a potential pharmacological target to inhibit breast cancer growth.",

            "abstract": "© 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd. Mechanistic understanding of how the brain gives rise to complex behavioral and cognitive functions is one of science's grand challenges. The technical challenges that we face as we attempt to gain a systems-level understanding of the brain are manifold. The brain's structural complexity requires us to push the limit of imaging resolution and depth, while being able to cover large areas, resulting in enormous data acquisition and processing needs. Furthermore, it is necessary to detect functional activities and 'map' them onto the structural features. The functional activity occurs at multiple levels, using electrical and chemical signals. Certain electrical signals are only decipherable with sub-millisecond timescale resolution, while other modes of signals occur in minutes to hours. For these reasons, there is a wide consensus that new tools are necessary to undertake this daunting task. Optical techniques, due to their versatile and scalable nature, have great potentials to answer these challenges. Optical microscopy can now image beyond the diffraction limit, record multiple types of brain activity, and trace structural features across large areas of tissue. Genetically encoded molecular tools opened doors to controlling and detecting neural activity using light in specific cell types within the intact brain. Novel sample preparation methods that reduce light scattering have been developed, allowing whole brain imaging in rodent models. Adaptive optical methods have the potential to resolve images from deep brain regions. In this roadmap article, we showcase a few major advances in this area, survey the current challenges, and identify potential future needs that may be used as a guideline for the next steps to be taken.",

Proprioceptive signals from peripheral mechanoreceptors form the basis for bodily perception and are known to be essential for motor control. However we still have an incomplete understanding of how proprioception differs between joints, whether it differs among the various degrees-of-freedom (DoFs) within a particular joint, and how such differences affect motor control and learning.We here introduce a robot-aided method to objectively measure proprioceptive function: specifically, we systematically mapped wrist proprioceptive acuity across the three DoFs of the wrist/hand complex with the aim to characterize the wrist position sense. Thirty healthy young adults performed an ipsilateral active joint position matching task with their dominant wrist using a haptic robotic exoskeleton. Our results indicate that the active wrist position sense acuity is anisotropic across the joint, with the abduction/ adduction DoF having the highest acuity (the error of acuity for flexion/extension is 4.64 ± 0.24°; abduction/adduction: 3.68 ± 0.32°; supination/pronation: 5.15 ± 0.37°) and they also revealed that proprioceptive acuity decreases for smaller joint displacements. We believe this knowledge is imperative in a clinical scenario when assessing proprioceptive deficits and for understanding how such sensory deficits relate to observable motor impairments.",
